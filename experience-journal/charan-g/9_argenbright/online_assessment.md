1. Given an integer 'num', we had to return the number of dots required to form a pentagon upto 'num' layers/iterations  
   - Example: for num=1, the first iteration, we need 1 dot to form a pentagon  
   - for num=2, we need 6 dots  
   - for num=3, we need 16 dots and so on  

2. Given an array arr, we needed to rotate the array at index n, where n is the first element of the array, we needed to return the elements as a concatenated string

## Raw Experience

- In the back of the mind, the thought that the company is still a startup was lingering  
- I had read reviews that there is very less scope for work life balance which I value a lot  
- But still I have given my best, I will decide the fate in the interview if I get shortlisted  
- I finished the test in about 42 minutes
