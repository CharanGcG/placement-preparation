# Group Discussion Experience

## Topic:
**Is EV the solution to India's pollution?**

*(The topic was predictable as the company is based on manufacturing of construction and mining vehicles, so the GD was aligned with the company’s interests.)*

---

## Positives:
- I addressed everyone while introducing myself.  
- I acknowledged others' perspectives.  
- I added to others' points and appreciated their contributions.  
- I smiled throughout and was diplomatic without any negativity.  
- I addressed the root cause of the issue and also proposed solutions.  
- I actively listened to others, showing attentiveness by nodding and maintaining eye contact.  

---

## Negatives:
- I was not able to maintain a continuous flow of words; got stuck a little.  
- At one point, two participants were dominating the discussion, and I was unsure how to continue. However, I eventually picked points from others and built upon them.  

---

## Takeaways from Others:
- One member was very fluent in his thoughts and had clearly prepared points.  
- I realized I can improve my fluency and structure my ideas more effectively.

## Points I Mentioned:
1. Overpopulation and dense population are the root causes of India’s pollution problem.  
2. Government needs to step up, conduct surveys, and provide a structured plan.  
3. India currently lacks the proper infrastructure for EV adoption since the system is set up around petrol, diesel, and gas vehicles.  
4. High cost of EVs is a major barrier for mass adoption compared to traditional vehicles.  
5. EV charging still depends largely on thermal energy, which causes pollution; focus should be on building nuclear power plants first.

## Overall Experience:
- A **good first experience**, enjoyable, and full of learning opportunities.  
- Helped me reflect on communication gaps and areas for improvement.
