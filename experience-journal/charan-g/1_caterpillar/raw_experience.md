For CS/IT stream students, we had to take an extra round of coding tests.

## First Round

The first round was completely based on aptitude:  
- English  
- Logical reasoning  
- Quantitative aptitude  
- SQL  
- Other computer science basics

## Second Round

The second round was an automata round, which was basically a coding round.  
It consisted of two easy level questions.
