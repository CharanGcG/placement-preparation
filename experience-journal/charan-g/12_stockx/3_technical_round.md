# Resume-Based Interview Experience

***

## Introduction

I introduced myself, and I was pretty impressed by myself that I could communicate so effectively and fluently once the fear and pressure factor was gone.

***

## Internship

I explained about the internship experience, what I worked on, the chat assistant API architecture, my role, and the testing scripts design and implementation.

***

## Projects

I explained the DSA gaming site—Alterstack and BSTree. This was also a very good explanation of my projects, but he stated a problem in my current BSTree implementation, which I accepted and told him that in the next version I will definitely implement it, as I had also updated based on my peers' feedback before.

***

## What is your favorite domain?

Web development.

***

## What technologies are you comfortable working on?

***

## Are you aware about Agile?

Yes, it is an iterative development process where developers collaborate using sprints—a set of tasks assigned to each of them working towards a deployment.

The interview went very smoothly. To add more context, this interview took place after all my 3 rounds at Oracle had completed, and I was full on confidence.
