# Final Interview Experience – End of the Day

***

Seriously, I was a bit tired—6th interview of the day!

But still, I woke up, gave my best, as always.

## Questions Asked

- **Describe your internship experience:**  
  I talked for around 5–10 minutes explaining my journey.

- **What are your weaknesses and how are you working on them?**  
  Perfectionism. We live in a practical world, so I am learning to accept that realism is preferable to idealism.

***

## Any Other Questions

- **Offer type:**  
  In Superset, it was only mentioned as internship as well as on the question paper for the pen and paper test, so I had to clarify about it. I got a reply that almost everyone gets converted, and only in rare cases where they feel the candidate won’t fit, they won’t convert.

- **How is the work-life balance?**  
  Hybrid is allowed, but since it is USA based, work can come at any time.

To be honest, if I had to give my real best, I would have asked many more questions which would make the HR give descriptive answers to make the interview long and engaging. But somewhere I had a feeling that Oracle had been done well and, as I was exhausted, I just couldn’t give my absolute best.

Thus, I wasn’t selected but was kept on standby—but then I got selected at Oracle.
