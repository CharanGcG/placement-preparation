# The Ultimate Day Ever in My Life

## Premise:
It was 2nd September 2025, Tuesday, I had come to the college to attend Okta PPT and test, we also had Deutsche Bank test that day, it was around 1:30pm when I was seated in the auditorium 1 along with Dinesh Kumar, that was when I received a notification from Oracle WhatsApp group, it was the interview shortlist, I was nervous as so many students had given the test, but my name was there! I was delighted and I begin thinking of the preparation right away. Just few minutes ago, I had also received a notification from StockX that I was shortlisted among 64 students to attend their hiring process. Both were scheduled for the same day - 3rd September 2025 Wednesday.  
I gave Deutsche Bank test as well (8:30 to 10:30 at night), and I revised few important concepts for the next day's interview.

## The Day:
I was supposed to attend StockX PPT at 8:00am, and Oracle's PPT at 8:30am, I had messaged Krish (Oracle's placement coordinator) about the overlapping schedules, he told me to wait for the updates, then I was notified that I could attend for both the processes. The placement team was supportive regarding this matter, I was really pleased by it.

### 0: StockX PPT and Test:
I attended the PPT of StockX, they were a great team and it was a really engaging presentation. Following the PPT was the pen and paper test, I have explained about the test under [12_stockx/1_pen_and_paper_test.md](../12_stockx/1_pen_and_paper_test.md).  
It was for one hour, this meant that I had to miss Oracle's PPT. By the time I had finished StockX's test, everyone had left from Oracle's PPT which took place in auditorium 2. I had to sign the attendance sheet and also submit my resume with my photo attached.

### 1: Oracle First Round Interview:
So after writing StockX's test, I was straight away called for Oracle's first round technical interview as the placement department facilitated us to participate in both the processes. It took around 1 hour, you can find that experience under [10_oracle/2_technical_round.md](../10_oracle/2_technical_round.md).

### 2: StockX First Round Interview:
Right after my Oracle's first round interview, I saw the StockX WhatsApp group and I was shortlisted for the next round. So I rushed towards PJ Block 2nd floor classroom 205, but I had to wait for my turn. It was time for lunch at around 1:30pm, I had brought lunch from home, I had it, and then I was called for StockX first round at around 2:20pm in another classroom.  
I finished the first round, it took around 30 minutes, and just when I stepped out of the classroom, Nidhi (StockX placement coordinator) informed me to head to the placement office for Oracle's second round.

### 3: Oracle Second Round Interview:
I rushed towards the placement office 2nd floor to give my Oracle's second interview, this was one of my coolest interview experiences, and you can read about it under [10_oracle/3_managerial_round.md](../10_oracle/3_managerial_round.md). I finished my interview and I waited outside to check if I had to run back to StockX interview, but there were no updates. Just then, after around 5 minutes, I was called for the HR round of Oracle.

### 4: Oracle Third Round Interview:
This was my fourth interview for the day, but I was really excited. This interview was one of my best interviews where I really loved my communication skills and I really felt that I had given my best to land that job at Oracle! You can read about it more under [10_oracle/4_hr_round.md](../10_oracle/4_hr_round.md).

### 5: StockX Second Round Interview:
I was just walking downstairs to go for a refreshing walk, but just then, Krish told me to head to StockX for my second interview. At this moment, I just felt that this was one of the days I would remember for a very long long time.  
I rushed towards PJ block 2nd floor, then I was made to wait a little as my interviewer had taken another candidate as I was not available. Then I gave my fifth interview for the day. This was one of those interviews where my mind was totally relaxed and I was just enjoying the process, so my interaction went really smooth. This was also one of my best performances in interviews, you can read more about it under [12_stockx/3_technical_round.md](../12_stockx/3_technical_round.md).

### 6: StockX Third Round Interview:
Then I was told that I would be going for the HR interview at StockX, I wanted to give my best, but I was a bit too tired by the end of the day. But still I stepped up and gave everything I had, but the thought that I had given my best at Oracle still lingered in my mind.
