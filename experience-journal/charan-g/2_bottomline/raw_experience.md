# Bottomline Online Assessment Experience

**Date:** 18/8/25

---

The online assessment consisted of **35 MCQs** and **2 coding questions**.  
All questions were of **hard level**.

---

## Coding Questions

Both coding questions were based on **dynamic programming (DP)**.  
I began to hate myself at one point during the test.

## Thoughts During the Test

There was also the PPO interview of Netradyne going on in my head,  
shouting at me for messing up the question for the job role.

But I found out that most of the other candidates also found it difficult.

---

## Aftermath

I really wanted to get into the interviews, but I couldn't make the cut.  
I felt disappointed in myself for not being able to solve the coding problems.

---

## Resolution

So, I decided to **up my coding game** so that any question is solvable, no matter the difficulty.

For that, I have to prepare with **focus, hard work, and smart work**,  
leaving out all distractions
