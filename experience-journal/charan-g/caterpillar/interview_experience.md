# Caterpillar Interview Experience

---

Caterpillar interview was my best performance, yet was not selected, so I guess life is like that—even when we give our best, it might not be enough!

But I really felt they liked me. There were two interviewers: one interviewer focused on the technical side, I explained a few concepts in detail, he told "good" many times. I asked a question about the company to the other interviewer, he explained it to me in detail. I really got that vibe that I may get selected, but only to know that I am not.

The only thing I felt didn't go perfect was with one DSA problem: maximum subarray sum.  
I started correctly with the sliding window approach, but I got a bit stuck while figuring out the condition to update the left pointer. I explained my thought process loudly to them, so the interviewer helped me out with it. This is the only thing I felt maybe a setback, but he seemed still ok with me.

## Interview Whole Process

### DSA Problems:
- Maximum subarray sum
- Find duplicates in unsorted array
- Two sum

### OOPS
- Explain all concepts using an example: I used shape and circle example (I think I need to be ready with a good example next time)

### Projects
- I explained the projects clearly, but I think I didn't mention the tech stack. Was that a problem? I am not sure.

## Positives

- I smiled whenever possible
- I asked clarifying questions
- I explained the polymorphism concept very clearly when they asked me a question while I was explaining with my example, and I was able to do it and he was impressed by it
- The interviewers seemed happy about me, I got that vibe
- I explained the thought process while solving the DSA problem, and I explained using examples and I also traced using the example

---

## Negatives

- As mentioned above, in the maximum subarray sum, I got stuck a little bit
- I felt I could talk more fluently, I was finding what word to tell when I got stuck
- Didn't mention about the tech stack while explaining about the projects
- I kind of fell back reluctant telling about my PCMB stream in PUC, then the interviewer asked specifically my stream, I felt they did that because I was about to tell it but didn't—was this a negative? Not sure!
- I felt my resume lacked achievements section, well I don't have major achievements yet

## Raw Experience

- The group discussion ended around 11:45 pm but my interview started at around 4pm! The waiting hours are a very difficult time to get past.  
- They didn't ask any question related to my work experience, which I felt was strange!  
- After the interview I really felt this was it! I thought I gave my best performance ever in interviews, somewhere I was really hoping for that offer! Since Caterpillar is a 100 year old company! And they have planned for another 100 years!  
- When the placement coordinator came in the waiting room and said expect one selected guy, rest of them from my batch can leave, I was kind of shocked to be honest. I really felt from the vibe I got from the interview, I would be selected. It took a while to process it and digest it.  
- Then I took a deep breath and walked out with knowing nothing to do, because a rejection after a bad performance is agreeable, but after a good performance, this was a new experience to me.

## Takeaways

- Even if you give 'your' best performance, it might not be enough for it to be 'the' best performance
- Learn from each experience and move on quickly!
- Don't keep any sort of expectations, keep an open mind, every rejection is a stepping stone not a barrier
