# Online Assessment Experience: Worst Ever

---

## Main Issue
- Nothing on the questions side of it, those were designed well, the problem was with the time duration  

---

## Problems Faced
- The test did not have a timer, it said we could take any amount of time required but it is advisable to take within 70 minutes  
- The test took place at college, the test was supposed to start at 4:30pm, so the ending time was supposed to be 5:30pm approx  
- But we were made to wait till we start, we started at 5pm, the questions were also actually lengthy  
- So we were forced to submit quickly, and the submission also became a problem  
- The submit button only gets enabled when we have answered every question, so we had to randomly choose answers to our questions and submit  
- We were instructed to finish as soon as possible, because the selected candidates from this round will get a link for the next round

## The Questions
- Scenario based questions: we had to submit an order of the possible actions we would take in a given scenario  
- Listening: we had to listen to videos, then answer true or false questions based on it  
- Aptitude: logical reasoning and quantitative (which I had to answer randomly)

## Overall Impression
- I felt the test was not well organized  
- A dedicated timer for the test must have been implemented  
- Else we should not have been hurried to submit the test
