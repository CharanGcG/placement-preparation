# Oracle HR Interview Experience

Immediately after the second round, maybe after 5 minutes, I was called in for an HR round—an interview with the HR.

***

## Interview Flow

Basically, the flow goes like this:  
Technical → Managerial → HR  
The weight of technical questions reduces as you go through the process, and your communication skills—clear, confident, and cheerful—are tested more.

***

## Basic HR Questions

- Are you legally authorized to work in India?  
- Why do you want to work in Oracle?

***

## Location Preference

"So, as you are from Bengaluru, it is your first preference, right?"  
I told that I am open to work anywhere, but if given a preference, I would choose Bengaluru.  
Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai, Pune—rank by order of preference of job location.

**My preference:** Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune  
**Why do you prefer Mumbai to Hyderabad?**  
I told that Mumbai was similar to Bengaluru in terms of the city life, and I would feel more like home there.

## Working Days

You have to come to office for all the five days—to which I responded, I love working in office, which I really do, as it excites me as a kid who always wanted to spend time on computers.

***

## Offer Details

You will be joining first as an intern for 6 months, after which you will be converted to full-time.

***

## Any Questions for Me?

This is a tricky and important question. You should be proactive and ask logical questions, preferably questions which require a lengthy descriptive answer, so that the interview can go on for many minutes.

**My question:**  
"Describe a day in your life at Oracle."  
I was told about the work culture there. There can be times when there is little to no work, and there may be times with deadlines, but there are flexible working hours. You have lunch here, you can play games, and you can work at any place at the office.

## What Do You Do Beyond Academics?

I told that I am passionate about art and sketching, and I also maintain an art profile on social media. I watch movies and TV shows.

***

## What Sports Do You Play?

I play cricket and table tennis (learnt during my internship), to which she told me they have many gaming courts, including table tennis, basketball, etc.

***

Then I added that I love working, since I am passionate about computers and working with computers, which I realized during my internship where I felt I was getting paid to do what I love.  
To this, she responded that it's great that I feel that way, but work-life balance is also important, to which I agreed, stating that it is also one of my priorities.

***

We ended our interview on a positive note with a few mind busters, jokes, which was really great. I felt that I had given my best performance ever in interviews, learning from my past—say, some 20 interviews.

***

## Takeaway

Be proactive, be human—if someone asks "how are you," respond "I'm good, and what about you?" Even if it is an interview or anything else, this goes a long way.
