# Oracle Interview Grind Experience

A total grind for about an hour! I'll break it down one by one!

***

## Introduction
I had to introduce myself. Initially, there were butterflies dancing in my stomach. I really wanted to land the job at Oracle! This was the company I was preparing for, and you can definitely call it my dream company!

***

## Internship Grind
- **What was your role in the internship?**  
- **What was the project you worked on? Explain it.**  
- **You mentioned in your resume that you have collaborated with the development team. Can you tell me exactly how?**

***

## Project Grind

### DSA Gaming Site Project
- **What is the essence of this project?**  
- **How is it different from other gaming sites?**  
- **Who are the end users?**  
- **How does it help the students?**  
- **Why did you make this project? What was the motivation behind it?**

### Smart Vehicle Ignition System
- **There are already keyless cars, what is the use of your system?**  
*(I told that I had no idea about it, I was frank about it)*  
- **What was your part in coding?**  
*(I told I was involved in cloud and IoT part, also helping in the frontend. I led my team.)*  
- **How does the system interact with the cloud?**  
*(Service account-based Google Cloud with google.cloud library, but I didn't know the depth of the implementation. I was frank about it.)*

## DBMS
- **What are structured data?**  
- **What are unstructured data?**  
- **What is the difference between structured and unstructured data? Give examples.**  
- **What are the different constraints in SQL?**  
- **Given a table with columns, what constraints do you apply to each of them?**  
*(It was an Employee table: [empid, empname, gender, managerid])*  
- **What are the different types of joins?**  
- **Print the employee name and his manager name from the above table**  
*(We have to use self join)*  
- **What are the different set operations?**  
Union, Intersection, Difference, Union All *(I had forgotten Union All, so I frankly told him I have forgotten it).*

***

## OOPS
- **What are abstract classes?**  
- **Difference between abstract and main class?**  
- **Can you give me an example why abstract classes are required?**  
*(I gave the example of Shape class with Circle and Square extending it. The Shape class has an abstract method area, and any class that wishes to extend the Shape class must inevitably implement the area method, without which it cannot be a Shape.)*  
- **What exactly is abstraction?**

***

## DSA
- **Given a string, find if it is a palindrome or not.**  
**My answers:**  
1. First, I gave a two-pointer approach (left and right) converging to the middle index.  
2. Then I was asked if I can implement it in another way – I told we could use a stack.  
3. Again, I was asked if there was another way – I told if it is a number, we could form a new number by obtaining the last digit iteratively.  
4. But I was expected to give yet another implementation – which I will be searching for now.

## Tricky and Funny Puzzle
```
1 = 5
2 = 25
3 = 125
4 = 625
5 = ?
```

Any guy who has prepared for aptitude will start to look for patterns/sequences, so did I.  
I told that they were the powers of 5, so 5^5 = 3125.  

But then I was asked to tell the sign that is used. I told it was the equal sign.  
So then I was told, if 1 = 5, won't 5 = 1?  

I was mind-blown, and we shared a funny little moment there, which ended the interview on a smiling note.
