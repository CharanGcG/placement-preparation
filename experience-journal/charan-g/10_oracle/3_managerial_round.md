# One of My Best Interview Experiences

I had just completed giving a coding interview at StockX, then the placement coordinator of StockX informed me to go for the Oracle second round at the placement office.

It was more of a managerial round, along with technical aspects as well, with a different interviewer.

## Introduction

The interviewer was a director at Oracle (which I got to know at the end). He made me comfortable, he was refreshing, and it gave me confidence to express myself at my highest potential.  
Usually, I tend to find it hard to have a smooth flow in communication during interviews, but this interview was a bit chill as I had StockX as a backup option as well, which let me express myself freely without much pressure.  
I mentioned my passion for art and sketching beyond academics, adding a personal touch.  
I touched upon the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the software industry and that I am adaptable and a continuous learner.  
I told that I value the journey more than the destination and that I keep upgrading every day, which is who I am.

## Projects

I was asked to pick any of my projects and explain it, first on a higher level and then going a bit technical.  
I picked the DSA Gaming Site since it was my personal project and I had built everything in that, unlike the Smart Vehicle Ignition project, which was a team project.  
I explained the gaming mechanics, the Alterstack game, the BSTree game, and how it flows at a higher level.  
Then, a bit technical— I explained how I used React to implement the game, using hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and how I managed the game states.

- **Have you worked on any authentication?**  
  I told yes, as I had worked with JavaScript Web Tokens (JWT) in a chat app for authentication.
- **Authentication vs Authorization:**  
  Authentication - who you are; Authorization - what you can access.

## OOPS

Since I had mentioned Java on my resume, I was once again asked about OOPS, mentioning the main pillars of OOPS.  
**Which pillar among OOPS do you think is the most important?** I answered encapsulation since it is the essence of object-oriented programming. I explained about the controlled access modification of the variables.  
I was asked which was the least access modifier - private.  
**Can you tell me about abstract classes?** I explained that objects cannot be created directly on abstract classes and only on the concrete classes that inherit from the abstract class.

## SQL

I was asked how comfortable I was with SQL on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most comfortable.  
I told that I don't want to exaggerate it, so I would say 3.5.

## What I Will Be Working On

I was explained about what I would be working on if I get hired. I was told about their cloud services, which I would be working on.

***

## Questions From My Side

"Describe a day in your life at Oracle."  
This is when I got to know that I was talking to a senior director whose experience is more than my age!  
He explained to me about his work, the designs, the meetings, the management. I was explained in detail about his life at Oracle.

The whole interview went on a positive note, and I really felt great during and after the interview.

## Takeaway

Always be yourself, try to reduce the pressure—it only impacts negatively. Keep a positive attitude with a smile, just enjoy the process, be true to yourself, be ethical. Being cheerful and having good communication skills is really important in every walk of life.
