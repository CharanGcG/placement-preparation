# The Day I Got Placed at Oracle - 3/9/25 - Wednesday

By the end of the day, I had given totally 6 interviews — 3 at StockX, 3 at Oracle  
StockX — 3/8 were selected from the HR round and they wanted to keep the other 5 as standby including me till Wednesday, to be honest I was really tired during HR interview of StockX and I really wanted to get into Oracle which was my target for the placements  
so I was on my way home hoping that I would get selected — not to forget I was also shortlisted among 7 people for the CEO interview at Argenbright Innovation Labs, it was supposed to take place on Saturday (way before Oracle interview), which got delayed and has not yet been completed — it feels like destiny is writing my story

I was just listening to songs while traveling in bus as always, but I was constantly checking the Oracle WhatsApp group for the results, by the time my stop came it began raining, so I took out my umbrella and started walking towards home still my mind on the WhatsApp group, I stopped at the skywalk near Townhall, and I started asking Dose (Dhanush C) how his interview went on WhatsApp, I also wanted to know how many guys had given 3 rounds to get an estimate whether I would be selected or not, he told me that I currently have like 3 offers in hand, to which I responded that my luck has been so bad that I may not even get one among the three offers

after sending that message, the notification from the Oracle WhatsApp group popped up! I just scanned through the names and I saw my name. yes, I saw my name, and it felt like a great relief and a personal win!

as a movie buff, the moment was cinematic I would say, I was half wet by the rain, holding the umbrella, it's raining from both sides with the skywalk roof over me, it felt like that scene from the movie where the hero finally gets what he worked hard for!

To add more context, I had not got PPO from Netradyne which I was expecting, I also was disappointed by that, I had given interviews for Caterpillar and Dish Networks after that where i got rejected by doing silly mistakes in communication

then Dose and Akash called me to congratulate me

I went home, got fresh, and I just smiled at my parents standing and they figured out that I was placed, they were really delighted by it, they had seen my hard work closely and were kind of expecting it (as all parents have high expectations), then I also told my brother about it when he reached home and he was delighted to hear it too and he told I got placed a lot earlier than he had expected

then various friends messaged me including Abhinav, Harshavardan, Jeevan, Danush

To be honest when I am writing this, I haven't completely sunk in the reality completely, being one among the 20 who got selected from the 833 registrations felt impossible, I am really grateful to the college, the placement and training department, all the faculty who have taught the fundamentals really well which helped a lot in my interviews, to be really honest, the placement team is doing a tremendous job at bringing in diverse companies, I really like to thank them, I will always be grateful for it, as the saying goes, "you are nothing but something not everything", being grounded is very important and most importantly, being the classic Charan is what is required now: "Continuous learning, Upgrading everyday!"
