## One of the Worst Interview Experiences

They had come for a **product manager role**, with only two interviewers present and about **26 shortlisted students**.  
The interview process was conducted from **10am till 5:30pm** with poor planning, and most students **indirectly rejected the offer** because they weren't interested in the job role.

My turn came just before lunch. I was asked only two questions:
- What is product management?
- If Amazon Prime is seeing a 30% decline in viewership in the last month, what will you do as a product manager?

The interview was **very short**. The panel took an extremely long time just to eliminate candidatesâ€”something that could have been done on the spot.
