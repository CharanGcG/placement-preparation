## Section Experiences

- **Core Java:**  
  A mix of medium and hard questions, mostly having several statements and picking the number of statements that are true, which takes a lot of time and patience.

- **Analytical Reasoning:**  
  Medium but I found it easy; a very good section from my perspective. Consisted of questions like seating arrangements, patterns, encoding and decoding.

- **AI/ML/Data Science:**  
  Had questions like decision trees, KNN, correlation matrix, time series analysis.

- **Quantitative Aptitude:**  
  I ran out of time for this section and had to randomly select options for about 4 questions. It consisted of questions like work and days, ratio, cost price and discount, $(6^{2n} - 5^{2n})$, and other common quantitative aptitude topics.
