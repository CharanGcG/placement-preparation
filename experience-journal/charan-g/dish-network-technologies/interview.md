## Topics Asked

- Projects
- Internship experience
- Coding question
- Explain your favorite theoretical concept

### Details

#### Projects

- What was the performance bottleneck you had faced in your project "Smart Vehicle Ignition System"?
- If you were given a chance to start the project from scratch again, what would you do differently?
- How exactly are the faces matched?
- What is the threshold you had kept for the face matching?

#### Internship

- How was the manual testing being done before you developed the automation scripts?
- Explain about the data queries.
- Was the chat assistant available publicly at HTTPS?

#### Coding Question

- Given two arrays containing the IDs of friends of two users, find the mutual friends.
    - I proposed the solution of using a dictionary to store the count of the IDs, and whichever ID has count 2 is a mutual friend.
    - I implemented using Python.
    - Then they asked me if I could implement using C as it doesn't have the data structure like dictionary.
    - I then proposed an O(m*n) approach where we traverse in nested arrays to check if an ID is present in the other array or not.
    - They wanted to test my logic building skills, which I think I was not able to deliver properly.

#### Your Favorite Concept: OOPs

- I told OOPs was my favorite concept since I like it and I had studied about it in detail.
- I explained using the bank account example which I have stored in this GitHub repo.

## Negatives

- Ending question: I asked how they evaluate the interns, which both of them got confused. I think it gave me a negative vibe.

---

## Positives

- I was able to talk about every topic in detail.
