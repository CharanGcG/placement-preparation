# NatWest Online Assessment Experience

---

The online assessments consisted of four parts: **Coding**, **Aptitude**, **SQL**, and **English**.

---

## Coding

The coding part was easy compared to usual coding rounds.  
Attempting the test the same day as Bottomline was such a contrastâ€”the difference in difficulty was clear!

## Aptitude

The aptitude round was fun, with drag-and-drop options, pie charts, bar graphs, patterns, etc.

## English

English covered grammar and comprehension.

---

## SQL

SQL had MCQ-type questions based on queries.
