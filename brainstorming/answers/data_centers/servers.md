A **server** is a specialized computer or software system that provides services, resources, or data to other computers (called clients) over a network. It operates on a client-server model, where clients send requests and the server processes and responds to those requests.

The **essential functionalities** without which a system would not be considered a server are:

- **Service Provision:** The server must deliver specific services such as hosting websites, managing databases, sending/receiving emails, storing files, or running applications for multiple clients.
- **Request-Response Model:** A server continuously listens for and processes incoming requests from clients, then sends back appropriate responses. This interaction must happen over a network.
- **Always On Availability:** Servers are designed for continuous operation (24/7) to ensure constant availability and reliable access to services by clients.
- **Resource Management:** A server manages resources like data storage, network bandwidth, or application processes to serve multiple clients efficiently and securely.
- **Handling Multiple Clients:** Servers can handle simultaneous requests from many clients, serving as a central hub for communication or data access.

Additionally, servers often have specialized hardware and software features to support these functions reliably, including multiple processors, large memory, redundant power supplies, and robust cooling systems.

In short, a server is defined by its role to **serve multiple clients by processing requests, managing resources, and providing continuous access to specific services over a network**. Without providing these network-based services and responding to client requests, a system does not qualify as a server.[1][2][3][4][5]

There are many different types of servers, each specialized to provide specific services or functions in a network or computing environment. Here are the most common types of servers:

- **Web Server**: Hosts websites and serves web pages to browsers using HTTP/HTTPS protocols (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
- **Database Server**: Manages databases and handles queries, ensuring data storage, retrieval, and integrity (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **Email Server**: Sends, receives, and stores email messages, often including spam filtering and virus scanning.
- **File Server**: Stores and manages files for multiple users in a centralized location for easier access and sharing.
- **Proxy Server**: Acts as an intermediary between clients and other servers, enhancing security and caching.
- **FTP Server**: Transfers files between computers via the File Transfer Protocol.
- **Application Server**: Provides an environment for running applications and services accessed by clients over a network.
- **DNS Server**: Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, essential for internet navigation.
- **Print Server**: Manages print jobs from computers to networked printers.
- **Game Server**: Hosts multiplayer online games and manages real-time player interactions.
- **Cloud Server**: Provides scalable virtualized resources over the internet.
- **Authentication Server**: Validates user identity and controls access to network resources.
- **Media Server**: Stores and streams media content such as videos and music.

In addition to functional types, servers also come in hardware forms:
- **Tower Server**: Vertical standalone units, suitable for small to medium businesses.
- **Rack Server**: Designed to be mounted in server racks, common in data centers.
- **Blade Server**: High-density modular servers housed in a chassis, optimized for large scale and virtualization.

These server types cater to different roles ranging from web hosting, data storage, application hosting, communication, and more, depending on the needs of the organization or system architecture.[2][3][5][6]
