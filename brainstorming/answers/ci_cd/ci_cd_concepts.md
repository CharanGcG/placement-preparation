A **CI/CD pipeline** (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery or Deployment) is an automated workflow enabling developers to ship code faster and with higher assurance of quality. It moves code through various automatic checks and gates, from commit to production. The pipeline concept can be understood at basic, intermediate, and advanced levels.[1][2][3]

***

## CI/CD Pipeline: Basics

- **Source/Commit:** Developers push changes to version control (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), which triggers the pipeline.[4][5]
- **Build:** The code is compiled or packaged, and dependencies are resolved. For container-based setups, this may generate Docker images.[3][1]
- **Test:** Automated unit, integration, and other tests are run to ensure code quality and functionality.[2][3]
- **Artifact/Package:** Successful builds produce a deployable artifact (binary, container image, etc.).[1]
- **Deploy (Staging):** The artifact is automatically deployed to a test or staging environment that mimics production. Additional checks and validations may occur here.[3][4]
- **Deploy (Production):** Once validated, the artifact is deployed to production, often using deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling).[4][3]

***

## Intermediate Concepts

- **Automated Triggers:** Pipeline runs may be triggered by code commits, pull requests, or scheduled events.[5][4]
- **Notifications:** The system provides real-time feedback on builds and tests (pass/fail) to developers via dashboards, chat, or email.[4]
- **Parallelization:** Multiple tests or builds may run in parallel for speed, especially important with large codebases.[1]
- **Pipeline as Code:** Pipelines are defined in version-controlled YAML or configuration files for transparency and repeatability.[3][1]

## Advanced CI/CD Practices

- **Reusable Components:** Advanced platforms allow reuse of pipeline steps/components, reducing duplication and boosting consistency.[6]
- **Dynamic Environments:** On-demand environments can be spun up automatically for feature branches or PRs for isolated testing.[6][3]
- **Quality Gates:** Security scans, code coverage, and static/dynamic analysis are incorporated as automated gates (failures block the pipeline).[6][3]
- **AI-Augmented Pipelines:** Modern pipelines may leverage AI for troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and optimizing workflows.[6]
- **Automated Rollbacks/Monitoring:** Monitoring systems trigger automated rollbacks if deployment health checks fail, ensuring high reliability.[3]
- **Infrastructure as Code:** The same pipeline can provision/deprovision infrastructure alongside application deployments using tools like Terraform or Helm.[3]
- **Progressive Delivery:** Advanced strategies (feature flags, A/B testing, canary, blue-green) control exposure to new features and minimize user impact.[4][3]

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages Table (Summary)

| Stage            | Purpose                                              | Key Tools/Practices                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Source/Commit    | Track code, trigger pipeline                         | Git, GitHub, branching                   |
| Build            | Compile/package code, resolve dependencies           | Jenkins, Docker, Maven                   |
| Test             | Run automated tests (unit/integration/security)      | pytest, JUnit, Selenium, SonarQube       |
| Artifact         | Generate deployable output                           | Docker images, JAR/WAR, binaries         |
| Staging Deploy   | Deploy to non-prod for further validation            | Kubernetes, Ansible, Helm                |
| Production Deploy| Push to production, may use progressive strategies   | ArgoCD, feature flags, blue-green/canary |
| Monitor/Rollback | Observe, maintain, and auto-rollback if issues arise | Prometheus, Grafana, alerting, rollbacks |
