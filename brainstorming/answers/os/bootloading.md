Great question — this is basically **"what happens when you press the power button"** → all the way until your operating system is ready to use. Let me break it step by step, from the **hardware (CPU + motherboard)** up to the **OS kernel** level.

---

## 🖥️ Step 1: Power-On and CPU Reset

* When you **switch on the computer**, the **power supply unit (PSU)** stabilizes voltages and signals the motherboard with `Power Good` signal.
* The CPU comes out of reset and begins execution.
  👉 Important: a CPU doesn’t start at “zero”; it starts execution from a **predefined memory address** hardwired into its architecture (on x86, it’s typically at `0xFFFF0`, which is mapped to the BIOS/UEFI ROM).

---

## 🔑 Step 2: BIOS/UEFI Firmware Initialization

* The CPU begins executing code from the **firmware (BIOS/UEFI)** stored in non-volatile memory (ROM/flash).
* This firmware performs:

  * **POST (Power-On Self Test)**: checks RAM, keyboard, GPU, etc.
  * **Hardware initialization**: sets up basic system devices.
  * **Interrupt vectors** and very minimal drivers (for keyboard, display).
* The firmware then searches for a **boot device** (HDD, SSD, USB, network, etc.) using the **boot order**.

---

## 📦 Step 3: Bootloader

* Once a bootable device is found, BIOS/UEFI loads the **bootloader** into memory and gives control to it.

  * Old BIOS: loads first 512 bytes (the **Master Boot Record**).
  * UEFI: loads an `.efi` executable from the EFI partition.
* The **bootloader’s job**:

  1. Switch CPU into a proper mode (Protected Mode / Long Mode on x86).
  2. Load the **OS kernel** into memory.
  3. Pass control to the kernel, often with a boot parameter block (memory map, device info, etc.).

Examples: **GRUB**, **Windows Boot Manager**, **systemd-boot**.

---

## ⚙️ Step 4: OS Kernel Initialization

* Now the **OS kernel** takes over:

  1. **Memory management**: sets up paging/virtual memory.
  2. **Process management**: initializes scheduler, process table.
  3. **Device drivers**: loads essential ones for disk, filesystem, interrupts, networking.
  4. **System calls**: prepares the interface for user programs to talk to hardware safely.
  5. **Init process**: the kernel starts the very first user-space process.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Step 5: User-Space Initialization

* The first user-space process (`init`, or nowadays `systemd` on Linux, `smss.exe` on Windows) starts:

  * Loads system services/daemons (network manager, login manager, etc.).
  * Mounts filesystems.
  * Starts background processes.

---

## 🖼️ Step 6: Login & User Session

* Finally, you’re presented with:

  * A **login prompt** (CLI) or
  * A **graphical login manager** (GUI).
* After login, your **shell** or **desktop environment** is launched, and you’re ready to interact with the OS.

### ⚡ In Short (Condensed Flow):

1. **Power On → PSU stable → CPU reset**
2. **BIOS/UEFI firmware runs → POST + hardware init**
3. **Bootloader loaded from disk → loads OS kernel**
4. **Kernel initializes memory, drivers, processes**
5. **Init/systemd starts services and user processes**
6. **Login screen/desktop ready**

---

👉 Notice: the OS itself only comes into play **after the bootloader** gives it control. Everything before that is hardware + firmware work.
