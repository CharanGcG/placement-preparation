The development to deployment phase of a software project follows a structured sequence of steps, ensuring that the product is built, tested, and released reliably. The core phases from development through deployment are: Planning, Analysis, Design, Development (Coding), Testing, Deployment, and finally, Maintenance.[1][2][3]

***

## Core Phases Explained

### 1. Planning & Analysis
This stage gathers requirements by consulting stakeholders, defines project goals, sets timelines, and allocates resources. Feasibility and risk assessments are often conducted to check if the project is realistic and valuable.[2][3]

### 2. Design
A blueprint for the systemâ€™s architecture is created, covering software structure, database models, interfaces, and technology choices. The aim is to translate requirements into implementable plans.[3][1][2]

### 3. Development (Coding/Implementation)
Developers write, test, and integrate the actual code as per design documents. Modern teams use version control and build automation to improve quality, track changes, and collaborate.[4][3]

### 4. Testing & Quality Assurance
Rigorous manual and automated testing is performed to ensure the product functions as intended. Common types include unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing. The focus is on catching defects and verifying that requirements are met.[1][4][3]

### 5. Staging/Pre-Deployment
Many projects use a staging environment that mirrors production for a live rehearsal. This helps detect any environment-specific issues, verify integrations, and ensure deployability with minimal downtime.[5][4]

### 6. Deployment
The software is moved to the production environment, making it available to end users. Teams schedule releases, communicate with stakeholders, and monitor for immediate issues. Techniques such as gradual rollout, blue-green deployments, or canary releases may be used.[6][7][4]

### 7. Monitoring & Maintenance
Post-deployment, ongoing monitoring (performance, errors, security) is critical, as is regular maintenance to resolve issues, release updates, and improve the system over time.[4][2][3]
