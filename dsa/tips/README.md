## General Approach

- **Read the problem statement carefully.**
- **Clarify constraints and edge cases.**
- **Identify the input/output format.**
- **Think of brute-force and optimal solutions.**
- **Choose the right data structure for the problem.**

---

## Before You Start Coding

- Write down sample inputs and expected outputs.
- List possible edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates, etc.).
- Plan your algorithm and time/space complexity.
- If allowed, write pseudocode or comments outlining your approach.
- Read all the questions first, then start by solving easy question and then move on to medium and finally the hard question

---

## During Coding

- Start with a working brute-force solution if stuck.
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Modularize your code (functions, helpers).
- Handle edge cases explicitly.
- Test with sample and custom cases as you code.
- Use built-in functions and libraries where appropriate.
- Try to print intermediate data to gain insights

---

## After Coding

- Double-check for off-by-one errors and boundary conditions.
- Test with large inputs for performance.
- Review your code for readability and efficiency.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Not handling empty or special cases.
- Misinterpreting the problem statement.
- Forgetting to update pointers/indices in loops.
- Infinite loops due to incorrect conditions.
- Not resetting variables between test cases.

---

## Extra Tips

- Practice typing and debugging quickly.
- Learn common patterns (sliding window, two pointers, binary search, etc.).
- Don’t spend too long on one question—move on if stuck.
- Use assert statements for quick checks.
- Stay calm and manage your time wisely.
