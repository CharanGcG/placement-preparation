# Quantitative Section: Quick Strategy & Tricks

## Profit & Loss

- **Key Formulas:**
  - Profit = Selling Price (SP) - Cost Price (CP)
  - Loss = Cost Price (CP) - Selling Price (SP)
  - Profit% = (Profit / CP) × 100
  - Loss% = (Loss / CP) × 100
  - Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
  - Selling Price = Cost Price - Loss

- **Tips:**
  - Memorize the shortcut formulas to find SP or CP quickly.
  - If given profit or loss percentage, use:  
    \( SP = CP \times \left(1 \pm \frac{\text{profit or loss}\%}{100}\right) \)
  - For multiple transactions, calculate net profit/loss by adding individual profits and losses.
  - Use approximate values if exact calculations take too long.

## Percentage

- **Quick Calculations:**
  - 10% of a number = divide by 10
  - 5% of a number = half of 10%
  - 1% of a number = divide by 100
  - Multiply or divide quickly by 110%, 90%, 75%, 125% using fraction equivalents:
    - 110% = 11/10, 90% = 9/10, 75% = 3/4, 125% = 5/4

- **Tips:**
  - Convert percentages into fractions or decimals to simplify multiplication.
  - For increase or decrease by a percentage, multiply by (1 ± %/100).
  - Use shortcut for successive percentage changes:
    - Overall change = product of each change factor - 1

## Ratio Problems

- **Key Points:**
  - Ratios represent parts of a whole or comparative quantities.
  - To combine ratios:  
    - Find LCM of terms for common base if needed.
    - Use the formula for combined ratio:  
      \( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd} \) (when applicable in quantities)

- **Tips:**
  - Convert ratios to fractions to solve parts problems quickly.
  - For problems involving multiple ratios, align terms to a common base before adding or comparing.
  - Use unitary method: find value of one part then multiply by required number of parts.

## Bar Graphs & Pie Charts

- **Quick Interpretation Tips:**
  - Identify total values when available and calculate percentages if needed.
  - For pie charts, remember total angle is 360°, so angle of sector = (Value/Total) × 360.
  - For bar graphs, focus on relative heights for comparison; exact values can be estimated.
  - Calculate difference or ratio between bars to answer comparison questions quickly.

- **Tips:**
  - Practice reading graphs to quickly derive values without re-reading the question.
  - Use approximations if exact numbers are not mandatory.
  - When asked percentage from bar graphs, convert given values accordingly.

## General Time-Saving Tips

- Skip very lengthy calculations; solve easier questions first.
- Use approximation and elimination in multiple-choice questions.
- Practice mental math techniques for faster calculations.
- Familiarize with common question patterns to reduce time in understanding.
- Use scratch paper for quick writing and calculation organization.
