# 2) Tech Stack ‚Äì What I Chose, Why, and the Trade-Offs

When they ask *‚ÄúWhy did you pick this stack?‚Äù* the trick is to sound deliberate. Here‚Äôs how you can frame it:

---

### **Frontend ‚Äì React**

* **Why I chose it**:

  * Easy camera integration (`getUserMedia`).
  * Component-driven, lets me quickly design multiple screens (Guest, Register, Login, Main).
  * Fast prototyping, widely used in the industry ‚Üí keeps my portfolio relevant.
* **Trade-off**:

  * A bit heavy for just a few screens; a simpler JS/HTML app would‚Äôve worked.
* **Future scope**:

  * Could migrate to **React Native** for mobile apps ‚Üí more natural for a car setting.

### **Backend ‚Äì Python (Flask/FastAPI)**

* **Why I chose it**:

  * Rich ecosystem ‚Üí `face_recognition`, `opencv-python`.
  * Serial communication to ESP32 is straightforward (`pyserial`).
  * FastAPI in particular makes REST APIs fast to implement and easy to test.
* **Trade-off**:

  * Python isn‚Äôt the fastest for high-scale inference; latency might creep in.
* **Future scope**:

  * Could port the recognition part to a **C++/Rust library** or wrap in **ONNX/TensorRT** for speed.
  * If scaling ‚Üí **containerize with Docker + deploy on GCP Cloud Run**.

### **Cloud ‚Äì Google Cloud Storage**

* **Why I chose it**:

  * Provides reliable image storage; easy bucket integration.
  * Simple service account JSON auth.
  * I could focus on core features instead of setting up my own storage server.
* **Trade-off**:

  * Latency ‚Üí pulling reference images from GCS for each attempt adds round-trip delay.
  * Security ‚Üí need to handle service account carefully; credentials must not leak.
* **Future scope**:

  * Pre-compute and store embeddings (vectors) instead of raw images ‚Üí reduces computation.
  * Could use **Firebase Auth + Firestore** for structured user management.

### **IoT Hardware ‚Äì ESP32 + Relay + Buzzer**

* **Why I chose it**:

  * ESP32 is cheap, low-power, and has both WiFi + serial ‚Üí good for IoT.
  * Relay module makes the ignition simulation realistic.
  * Buzzer is a simple but effective alert mechanism.
* **Trade-off**:

  * Right now, serial USB ‚Üí ties me to a laptop/PC. Not production-ready.
  * ESP32 is powerful but limited for on-device face recognition.
* **Future scope**:

  * Replace serial with **MQTT over WiFi** ‚Üí backend can trigger ignition remotely.
  * Move to **edge AI hardware** (e.g., ESP32-CAM, Raspberry Pi, or Coral TPU) for liveness detection and local inference.

### **Overall Design Choice**

* **Why this stack works for me as a student project:**

  * Balances **practicality (working prototype)** with **industry buzzwords (AI + IoT + Cloud + Web)**.
  * Shows I can **integrate multiple layers**, not just code in isolation.

* **If I had to redo for production:**

  * Swap serial ‚Üí MQTT.
  * Store embeddings in DB ‚Üí not images.
  * Add **JWT-based auth** for API.
  * Add **CI/CD** to auto-test and deploy.

üëâ This way, when asked ‚ÄúWhy React? Why Python? Why ESP32?‚Äù you won‚Äôt sound like you just randomly picked them ‚Äî you‚Äôll sound intentional, while also showing maturity by recognizing trade-offs.
