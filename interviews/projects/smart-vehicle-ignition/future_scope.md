# 4) Proposed Improvements & Implementation Plan

### 🔹 **Add Liveness Detection (Anti-Spoofing)**

* **Problem**: Current system can be fooled by photos/videos.
* **Improvement**: Integrate liveness detection. Options:

  1. **Blink/Smile Challenge** → Ask user to blink or smile → check movement.
  2. **IR/Depth Camera** → Detect 3D depth; harder to spoof with 2D images.
  3. **ML-based liveness models** → Pre-trained models that classify real vs spoof.
* **Implementation**:

  * Use libraries like `deepface` or OpenCV eye-blink detection for a quick start.
  * If hardware budget allows → ESP32-CAM with IR sensor.

### 🔹 **Optimize Face Recognition Pipeline**

* **Problem**: Each request recomputes embeddings, slow at scale.
* **Improvement**: Store **pre-computed embeddings** instead of raw images.
* **Implementation**:

  * At registration → compute face embeddings once, store in DB (e.g., Firestore, PostgreSQL).
  * At login → only compute captured embedding, compare with stored vector.
  * This reduces runtime CPU load and bandwidth.

### 🔹 **Replace Serial with Secure IoT Protocol**

* **Problem**: Serial USB → tethered to PC, not deployable in real car.
* **Improvement**: Use **MQTT over TLS** between backend and ESP32.
* **Implementation**:

  * Deploy **Mosquitto broker** or use **GCP IoT Core (deprecated) → shift to AWS IoT Core / Azure IoT Hub**.
  * ESP32 subscribes to “/vehicle/ignition” topic; backend publishes “unlock/lock” messages.
  * Add TLS certs to ESP32 for secure comms.

---

### 🔹 **Fail-Safe Hardware**

* **Problem**: Relay might get stuck in “unlocked” if backend crashes.
* **Improvement**: Add **watchdog timer + hardware default-locked state**.
* **Implementation**:

  * ESP32 auto-resets relay to locked after timeout unless refreshed by valid unlock.
  * Add hardware fuse that defaults to OFF state if power/hardware fails.

---

### 🔹 **User Management Portal**

* **Problem**: No structured way to manage users.
* **Improvement**: Build an **admin dashboard** with CRUD for users.
* **Implementation**:

  * Add Firebase Auth or JWT-based login.
  * Store users + embeddings in Firestore/SQL.
  * Allow admin to revoke user access anytime.

---

### 🔹 **Resilience in Low Connectivity Areas**

* **Problem**: Dependent on cloud internet.
* **Improvement**: Add **edge inference fallback**.
* **Implementation**:

  * Deploy lightweight model on ESP32-CAM or Raspberry Pi.
  * If offline → local recognition; if online → cloud verification for accuracy.

---

### 🔹 **Logging, Monitoring, and Testing**

* **Problem**: No monitoring/testing in current prototype.
* **Improvement**: Add logging, error tracking, and CI/CD.
* **Implementation**:

  * Use Python `logging` + push logs to cloud (Stackdriver / ELK).
  * Add unit tests for recognition + API endpoints.
  * GitHub Actions for CI: run tests on each commit.

---

### 🔹 **UI/UX Enhancements**

* **Problem**: Current UI is functional but not very user-friendly.
* **Improvement**: Add feedback messages, loading states, and confidence score display.
* **Implementation**:

  * Use React toast notifications (e.g., `react-hot-toast`).
  * Show recognition confidence bar.
  * Give user hints like “Too dark, adjust lighting.”

# ✨ How You Pitch This in an Interview

Instead of just listing “future scope,” tie each improvement to **real-world impact**:

* “If given more time, I’d add **liveness detection**, so attackers can’t bypass with photos.”
* “I’d shift from **serial to MQTT**, so it’s wireless and closer to how IoT cars work in real life.”
* “I’d store **pre-computed embeddings** instead of images, so the backend is much faster and scalable.”
* “I’d add a **watchdog timer** so that even if the backend fails, the relay defaults to locked.”

This way, you sound **practical, security-conscious, and forward-looking**.

1. How to explain the project.
2. Tech stack choices + trade-offs.
3. Current limitations (with self-awareness).
4. Future improvements (with actual implementation ideas).
