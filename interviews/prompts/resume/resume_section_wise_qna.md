**Title:**
Top {N} Resume-Based Interview Questions on {section} with 5-Star Answers

**Prompt:**
I have uploaded a resume. Generate **{N} possible interview questions** that an interviewer could realistically ask based **only on the {section} section** of this resume. If `{section}` = “entire resume,” consider the whole resume.

For each question, provide:

1. **Question** – framed exactly as an interviewer might ask, based directly on the candidate’s {section}.
2. **5-Star Answer** – a clear, professional, and structured answer suitable for impressing an interviewer. Include:

   * Concise explanation of the experience, skill, or project mentioned.
   * Achievements quantified where possible.
   * STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format for project or internship questions.
   * Soft skills or personal qualities highlighted subtly.
3. **Why the Interviewer Asks This** – insight into what the interviewer is trying to assess (skills, experience, attitude, problem-solving, etc.).

**Additional Instructions (Optional but Recommended):**

* Questions should **only focus on the specified {section}**, unless `{section}` = “entire resume.”
* Include questions that are **likely to be asked in real-world interviews**, not just theoretical.
* Provide answers **that a candidate could realistically give**, but that stand out as excellent.
* Keep the tone **professional, confident, and positive**.
* Output should be in a **structured numbered list** for clarity.

**Example Variables:**

* `{N}` → 10, 15, 20 (number of Q\&A pairs requested)
* `{section}` → Projects / Skills / Internships / Academics / Hobbies / Certifications / Entire Resume
* Resume → uploaded by the user
