*"Imagine you are a campus placement interviewer reviewing a fresher’s resume for shortlisting. Please evaluate the resume as if you are deciding whether this candidate should move forward in the recruitment process. Your evaluation should be:*

1. **Overall Impression & Rating** – Provide an honest rating of the resume on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 = very weak and 10 = excellent. Consider relevance for entry-level roles in software/IT.

2. **Strengths** – Highlight the aspects of the resume that stand out positively (e.g., projects, internships, skills, certifications, formatting, clarity).

3. **Areas of Improvement** – Point out gaps, weaknesses, or red flags (e.g., lack of depth, poor structuring, missing impact metrics, irrelevant content). Be constructive and suggest specific ways the candidate can improve.

4. **Recruiter’s Lens** – Assess whether this resume would likely catch the attention of campus recruiters under high competition (many resumes to filter quickly).

5. **Industry Relevance** – Comment on whether the resume reflects readiness for real-world job roles (software engineer, SDET, data analyst, etc.), or if it still feels academic.

6. **Desirables** – Suggest additional elements the candidate could add to make the resume stronger (e.g., quantified achievements, GitHub links, certifications, leadership experience, clean formatting, ATS optimization).

*Your feedback should be detailed, practical, and unbiased — as if you were actually deciding whether to interview this candidate in a competitive campus placement scenario."*
