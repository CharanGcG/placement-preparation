# üìò Problem Documentation: **House Relocation by Language Grouping**

### **Problem Statement**

We are given an array where:

* Each index represents a **house**.
* Each element represents the **language** spoken in that house (an integer).
* Maximum language value is **K** (languages are `1..K`).

The **goal** is to relocate houses so that people who speak the **same language are grouped together**.
Allowed operation:

* A house at index `i` can be swapped **only with its immediate neighbor** (`i-1` or `i+1`).

We must compute the **minimum number of swaps** required to reach the most optimal arrangement.

---

### **Example Test Cases**

#### Example 1

```
Input:  [1, 2, 1, 2]
Output: 1
```

**Explanation:**

* If we swap index `1 (value=2)` with index `2 (value=1)`, we get `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.
* Only **1 swap** is needed.

---

#### Example 2

```
Input:  [3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1]
Output: 4
```

**Explanation:**
One optimal arrangement is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.
The minimum swaps required to cluster same-language houses = **4**.

---

#### Example 3

```
Input:  [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Output: 6
```

**Explanation:**
Final arrangement could be `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.
To bring same languages together, at least **6 swaps** are required.

### **Approach to Consider**

1. **Observation**

   * This problem is about **minimum adjacent swaps to cluster identical elements**.
   * The key difficulty is that we can only swap with neighbors.

2. **Core Idea**

   * For each language group, their final position must be a **contiguous block**.
   * To minimize swaps, we want to bring all instances of a language close to their **median position**.
   * This is similar to the "minimum adjacent swaps to make elements consecutive" problem.

3. **Steps**

   * Collect all indices of each language.
   * For each language `L`:

     * Suppose its positions are `[i1, i2, i3, ‚Ä¶, im]`.
     * Find the **median index** `mid`.
     * Target positions will be `[t, t+1, t+2, ‚Ä¶, t+m-1]` centered around `mid`.
     * Number of swaps = `Œ£ |ij - (t + j)|`.
   * Add this for all languages.
   * Return the total minimum swaps.

### **Solution (High-Level Pseudocode)**

```python
def min_swaps(arr):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Step 1: Collect positions of each language
    positions = defaultdict(list)
    for i, val in enumerate(arr):
        positions[val].append(i)
    
    swaps = 0
    
    # Step 2: For each language group
    for lang, idxs in positions.items():
        m = len(idxs)
        # Median-based alignment
        median = idxs[m // 2]
        
        # Target positions: [median - m//2 ... median + m//2]
        for j in range(m):
            swaps += abs(idxs[j] - (median - m//2 + j))
    
    return swaps
```

### **Complexity**

* Time: **O(N)** (since we just collect indices and compute differences).
* Space: **O(N)** (storing positions).

### **How to Face Similar Questions in Future**

1. **Look for ‚Äúgrouping‚Äù or ‚Äúclustering‚Äù patterns** ‚Üí Think about median alignment.
2. **Remember adjacent swaps = distance between current index and target index.**
3. **Break problem into groups** (one language at a time, one character at a time).
4. **Try greedy median approach** instead of brute force.
5. **Practice related swap problems** so spotting the pattern becomes natural.
