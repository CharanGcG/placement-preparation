**Title:**
Top {N} {Concept}-based Interview Questions for Freshers/Experienced Candidates

**Prompt:**
I want a list of the **top {N} interview questions about {Concept}**, specifically **basic questions** that serve as a “make-or-break” check. If a candidate **cannot answer these**, it indicates they fundamentally **do not understand {Concept}**.

For each question, provide:

1. **Question** – phrased exactly as an interviewer might ask.
2. **Detailed Answer** – a clear, concise, and thorough explanation suitable for a fresher or intermediate candidate.
3. **Why the Interviewer Asks This** – insight into what the interviewer is trying to assess (conceptual understanding, practical knowledge, common pitfalls, etc.).

**Additional Instructions (Optional but Recommended):**

* Include **examples or code snippets** if relevant.
* Include **common misconceptions** the candidate might have.
* Keep the tone **professional yet easy to understand**.
* If the concept has sub-concepts, cover at least one **important sub-concept**.
* Output should be in a **structured numbered list** for easy reading.

**Variables:**

* `{N}` → 
* `{Concept}` →
