**Title:**
One Memorable Example to Explain {topic} in Interviews

**Prompt:**
I want you to give me **one single example or analogy** that clearly explains all the **key concepts of {topic}**.

The example should be:

1. **Easy to remember** – simple enough that I can recall it instantly in an interview.
2. **Easy to explain** – short, structured, and not too complicated.
3. **Impressive for interviewers** – makes me stand out as someone who understands {topic} deeply.
4. **Comprehensive** – should cover all the **important aspects of {topic}** (even subtle ones).
5. **Professional & Clear** – something that can be confidently explained in 1–2 minutes.

**Additional Instructions (Optional but Recommended):**

* Use **real-world analogies** or **relatable scenarios** (e.g., banking, hospital, school system, car, etc.).
* If {topic} has multiple sub-concepts (e.g., OOP → Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism), integrate all of them naturally into the example.
* Avoid making it too technical or too academic – it should feel natural and conversational.
* Output should be **structured**, so I can directly memorize and use it.

**Variables:**

* `{topic}` →
