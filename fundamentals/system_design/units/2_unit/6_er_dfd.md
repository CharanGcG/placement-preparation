Let’s dive into the last two **modeling techniques** for **Unit II**: **ER Modeling (Entity-Relationship Modeling)** and **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**.
These are classics for system analysis and modeling — still used in real projects alongside UML.

# **7. ER Modeling (Entity–Relationship Modeling)**

### 🔹 What is ER Modeling?

* A **conceptual data model** used to describe the **structure of data**.
* Focuses on:

  * **Entities** → Objects in the system.
  * **Attributes** → Properties of entities.
  * **Relationships** → How entities interact.

---

### 🔹 Components of ER Model

1. **Entity** – Rectangle (e.g., Student, Course, Book).

   * Strong entity: Exists independently.
   * Weak entity: Depends on another entity.

2. **Attribute** – Oval (e.g., Name, Age, Roll No).

   * Primary key: Uniquely identifies entity.
   * Derived attribute: Calculated (e.g., Age from DOB).

3. **Relationship** – Diamond (e.g., “Enrolls”, “Borrows”).

   * One-to-One (1:1), One-to-Many (1\:N), Many-to-Many (M\:N).

---

### 🔹 Example 1: **Student Record System (SRS)**

Entities & Relationships:

* `Student (id, name, dept)`
* `Course (id, name, credits)`
* `Enrollment (grade, semester)`

Relationships:

* A **Student** can enroll in many **Courses**.
* A **Course** can have many **Students**.
  👉 M\:N relationship resolved by `Enrollment`.

---

### 🔹 Example 2: **Library Management System**

Entities & Relationships:

* `Member (id, name, email)`
* `Book (id, title, author)`
* `Transaction (issueDate, returnDate, fine)`

Relationships:

* A **Member** can borrow many **Books**.
* A **Book** can be borrowed by many **Members** (over time).

✅ **Checkpoint for Students:**
Draw an ER diagram for an **Online Exam System**: Entities → Student, Exam, Question, Result.

# **8. Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)**

### 🔹 What is a DFD?

* A **graphical representation** of how **data moves through a system**.
* Focus: *Processes, data stores, and data flows*.
* Great for understanding **functional perspective** of a system.

---

### 🔹 Components of a DFD

1. **Process (Circle)** – Activity that transforms input to output (e.g., “Process Order”).
2. **Data Store (Open Rectangle)** – Where data is stored (e.g., “Database”).
3. **External Entity (Square)** – Outside system actors (e.g., Customer, Admin).
4. **Data Flow (Arrow)** – Movement of data between entities, processes, stores.

---

### 🔹 DFD Levels

* **Level 0 (Context Diagram)** → Big picture (system as a single process).
* **Level 1** → Breaks the system into main sub-processes.
* **Level 2+** → More detailed decomposition.

---

### 🔹 Example 1: **Food Delivery App**

**DFD Level 0 (Context Diagram):**

* Customer → \[Food Delivery System] → Restaurant
* Delivery Partner ← \[System] ← Restaurant
* Payment Gateway ↔ \[System]

**DFD Level 1:**

* Processes: Place Order, Make Payment, Update Menu, Assign Delivery.
* Data Stores: Orders DB, Payment DB, User DB.

---

### 🔹 Example 2: **Banking System**

**DFD Level 0:**

* Customer → \[Banking System] → Account DB
* Payment Network ↔ \[Banking System]

**DFD Level 1:**

* Processes: Create Account, Transfer Funds, Generate Statement.
* Data Stores: Customer DB, Transaction DB.

---

### 🔹 Why ER & DFD are Important

* ER → **Data-centric view** (structure of information).
* DFD → **Process-centric view** (flow of information).
* Together, they ensure both **data design** and **functional design** are well thought out.

---

✅ **Checkpoint for Students:**

1. Draw an ER diagram + Level 1 DFD for a **Hospital Management System** (Entities: Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Bill; Processes: Book Appointment, Generate Bill).
2. How would you refine a DFD from Level 0 → Level 2 for a **Food Delivery App**?

🎯 With this, we’ve **completed Unit II (Requirements and Modeling)**.
So far, we’ve covered:

* Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements
* UML Diagrams (Use Case, Class, Sequence, Component, Deployment)
* ER Diagrams
* DFDs
