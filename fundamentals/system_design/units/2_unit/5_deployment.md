Let’s move into the **next pair of UML diagrams**: **Component Diagrams** and **Deployment Diagrams**.
They go hand-in-hand because:

* **Component Diagram** → *Logical view* (how the software system is broken into components/modules).
* **Deployment Diagram** → *Physical view* (how those components run on actual hardware/servers/cloud).

# **5. UML Modeling – Component Diagram**

### 🔹 What is a Component Diagram?

* Shows the **organization and dependencies** among system components (modules, services, packages).
* Think of it as the **“blueprint of the codebase at a higher level”**.
* Focus: *Logical grouping & interfaces*.

---

### 🔹 Example: **Food Delivery App – Component View**

**Main Components:**

* **User Service** – Authentication, profile.
* **Order Service** – Cart, order placement.
* **Payment Service** – Payment processing, refunds.
* **Restaurant Service** – Menu, order management.
* **Delivery Service** – Rider assignment, tracking.

**Relationships (text version):**

```
[User Service] ----> [Order Service] ----> [Payment Service]
                            |                     |
                            v                     v
                  [Restaurant Service]      [External Payment Gateway]
                            |
                            v
                    [Delivery Service]
```

👉 Key point: Each service is **independent and communicates via APIs**.

# **6. UML Modeling – Deployment Diagram**

### 🔹 What is a Deployment Diagram?

* Shows how software components (from component diagram) are **deployed onto physical infrastructure**.
* Focus: *Servers, databases, networks, and how they interact*.

---

### 🔹 Example: **Food Delivery App – Deployment View**

```
+------------------------+        +-------------------------+
|   Web/Mobile Client    |        |  Delivery Partner App   |
+------------------------+        +-------------------------+
              |                                |
              v                                v
        +---------------------------------------------+
        |              Application Server             |
        |   - User Service                            |
        |   - Order Service                           |
        |   - Payment Service                         |
        |   - Restaurant Service                      |
        |   - Delivery Service                        |
        +---------------------------------------------+
                        |
                        v
        +---------------------+     +----------------------+
        |   Database Server   |     |  External Services   |
        |   (Orders, Users)   |     |  (Payment Gateway,   |
        |                     |     |   SMS/Email API)     |
        +---------------------+     +----------------------+
```

👉 This maps **logical services → physical nodes** (servers, DB, 3rd party APIs).

### 🔹 Example: **Banking System – Deployment View**

* **Client Layer**: Mobile Banking App, Web App.
* **Application Layer**: Core Banking Service, Transaction Service, Authentication Service.
* **Data Layer**: Customer DB, Transaction DB.
* **External Systems**: Payment Network, SMS/Email notification service.

---

### 🔹 Why These Matter

* **Component Diagram** → Helps developers organize system into modules.
* **Deployment Diagram** → Helps DevOps/architects plan infrastructure.
* Together, they bridge the **software world** and the **real-world infrastructure**.

✅ **Checkpoint for Students**

1. Draw a **component diagram** for a **Student Record System** (components: Student Service, Course Service, Grade Service, Report Service).
2. Extend it into a **deployment diagram** (Application Server + Database Server + Admin/Student Clients).
