# **2. Difference between Software Design and System Design**

Many students confuse these two terms because both deal with ‚Äúdesigning something before building it.‚Äù But they **differ in scope, focus, and level of abstraction**.

---

### üîπ **Software Design**

* Focuses only on **software components** of a system.
* Deals with **detailed design** of classes, modules, functions, and algorithms.
* Concerned with **data structures, APIs, and implementation details**.
* It is **narrower** in scope than system design.

üëâ **Example**:
In an **E-commerce website**, software design will specify:

* Product class (attributes: name, price, stock).
* Shopping cart logic (add/remove items).
* Payment service code (API endpoints).

---

### üîπ **System Design**

* Broader ‚Äì includes **software + hardware + networking + external interfaces**.
* Focuses on **overall architecture** of the system.
* Concerned with **scalability, reliability, integration, security, and communication between subsystems**.
* Provides a **blueprint for both software and hardware**.

üëâ **Example**:
For the same **E-commerce website**, system design will specify:

* Architecture: Microservices vs. Monolith.
* Database: SQL vs. NoSQL, sharding strategy.
* Load balancing, caching layers (Redis, CDN).
* Integration with payment gateways, logistics APIs.
* Deployment strategy (cloud servers, containers, monitoring tools).

### üîπ **Key Differences Table**

| Aspect        | **Software Design**                          | **System Design**                                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**     | Narrow (only software modules).              | Broad (software + hardware + network + environment).                          |
| **Focus**     | Code structure, logic, algorithms.           | Overall architecture, data flow, component interaction.                       |
| **Level**     | Low-level (closer to coding).                | High-level (closer to architecture).                                          |
| **Output**    | Class diagrams, pseudocode, database schema. | Architectural diagrams, system workflows, tech stack.                         |
| **Timeframe** | Comes after system design.                   | Comes before software design.                                                 |
| **Example**   | Designing the ‚ÄúCart Service‚Äù logic.          | Designing how Cart Service, Inventory, and Payment modules interact at scale. |

### üîπ **Analogy**

Think of **building a city**:

* **System Design** ‚Üí Deciding city layout: roads, electricity grid, water supply, zoning.
* **Software Design** ‚Üí Designing individual houses: floor plan, plumbing, wiring of one building.

‚úÖ **Checkpoint for students:**

* **Why is it risky to skip system design and jump straight into software design?**  
  Skipping system design means you might miss critical decisions about scalability, reliability, integration, and security. Without a clear overall architecture, your software components may not work well together, leading to issues like poor performance, bottlenecks, or inability to handle growth.

* **Can you identify one system design decision and one software design decision in building a mobile banking app?**  
  - **System design decision:** Choosing a secure client-server architecture with encrypted communication, load balancing, and integration with third-party payment gateways.
  - **Software design decision:** Designing the "Transaction" class with attributes like amount, date, sender, receiver, and implementing validation logic for fund transfers.
