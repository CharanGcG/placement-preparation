Yes, you're on the right track! **Amusement parks** are a good real-world example of systems where **high reliability** is prioritized over **availability**. Let’s break it down and introduce more examples for clarity.

## Amusement Parks: High Reliability, Low Availability

- **High Reliability:** Rides and attractions are thoroughly inspected, maintained, and tested to ensure they operate safely and as designed. Safety (reliability) is the absolute priority—failures can have severe consequences.
- **Low Availability:** Because of stringent maintenance, rides may be shut down often for checks, repairs, or due to adverse weather. They might be unavailable for significant periods, but whenever a ride operates, it is trustworthy and safe.

## More Real-World Examples

### 1. **Medical Equipment (e.g., MRI machines)**
  - **High reliability:** Must work perfectly when in use because any malfunction can impact patient safety.
  - **Low availability:** Machines may be offline for regular calibration, cleaning, or due to high demand and limited scheduling.

### 2. **Spacecraft or Satellites**
  - **High reliability:** Systems are built to operate flawlessly when powered on, as repair is impossible.
  - **Low availability:** Equipment may remain off for long stretches, only activated for specific experiments or data transfers to conserve power and resources.

### 3. **Nuclear Power Plant Emergency Systems**
  - **High reliability:** Safety mechanisms must work whenever something goes wrong.
  - **Low availability:** These systems remain idle most of the time, only triggered during emergencies or drills.

### 4. **Old Backup Generators**
  - **High reliability:** Expected to start and operate perfectly during a power outage.
  - **Low availability:** They’re seldom used; just stand by, with periodic maintenance.

### 5. **Luxury or Heritage Transportation**
  - **High reliability:** Think of historic trains or vintage aircraft. Whenever they run, everything must be in perfect order for safety and preservation.
  - **Low availability:** Operate rarely due to cost, special permissions, or complex upkeep requirements.

## Key Takeaway

**High reliability + low availability** means:  
The system is available less often, but when it’s “on,” it works without fail—usually because failure would be very costly, dangerous, or unacceptable. This is common in scenarios where safety or accuracy is critical.
