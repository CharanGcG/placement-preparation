## üìö **Case Study 1: Library Management System (LMS)**

### **Problem Statement**

Design a system to manage books in a library: issuing, returning, tracking availability, and maintaining member records.

---

### **Step 1: Requirements**

* **Functional requirements**:

  * Add/remove/search books.
  * Register members.
  * Issue and return books.
  * Track due dates and fines.
* **Non-functional requirements**:

  * Scalability: Handle multiple libraries.
  * Availability: System should work even during peak usage.
  * Maintainability: Should allow adding e-books later.

---

### **Step 2: High-Level Design (System Design View)**

**Main Modules**:

* **User Module** ‚Äì Member registration, login.
* **Book Module** ‚Äì Catalog, search, availability.
* **Transaction Module** ‚Äì Issue, return, fines.
* **Admin Module** ‚Äì Add/remove books, manage members.

**Architecture**:

* Client (Web/Mobile App) ‚Üî API Layer ‚Üî Database

---

### **Step 3: Low-Level Design (Software Design View)**

**Entities (ERD)**:

* `Book (id, title, author, category, availability)`
* `Member (id, name, email, membershipType)`
* `Transaction (id, bookId, memberId, issueDate, returnDate, fine)`

**Use Case Diagram** (text version):

* Member ‚Üí Search Book, Issue Book, Return Book
* Admin ‚Üí Add Book, Remove Book

---

üëâ **Design Methodology Used:**

* **Top-Down**: Start with whole library, break into modules.
* **Modular Design**: Separate book, user, and transaction modules.

---

## üéì **Case Study 2: Student Record System (SRS)**

### **Problem Statement**

Design a system to store and manage student academic records, including courses, grades, and personal details.

---

### **Step 1: Requirements**

* **Functional requirements**:

  * Store student details (name, roll number, department).
  * Maintain course enrollment.
  * Store and retrieve grades.
  * Generate transcripts.
* **Non-functional requirements**:

  * Reliability: No loss of records.
  * Availability: Should be accessible anytime by faculty/students.
  * Maintainability: Should support new grading systems later.

---

### **Step 2: High-Level Design**

**Main Modules**:

* **Student Module** ‚Äì Registration, profile management.
* **Course Module** ‚Äì Course catalog, enrollment.
* **Grades Module** ‚Äì Grade entry, transcript generation.
* **Admin Module** ‚Äì Faculty management, report generation.

**Architecture**:

* Web/Mobile UI ‚Üî Application Server ‚Üî Database

---

### **Step 3: Low-Level Design**

**Entities (ERD)**:

* `Student (id, name, rollNo, dept)`
* `Course (id, name, credits)`
* `Enrollment (studentId, courseId, semester, grade)`

**Use Case Diagram (text version):**

* Student ‚Üí View Courses, Enroll in Course, View Transcript
* Faculty ‚Üí Enter Grades, Generate Reports

---

üëâ **Design Methodology Used:**

* **Bottom-Up**: Start by designing `Student`, `Course`, `Enrollment` tables, then integrate.
* **Modular**: Separate student, course, and grade modules.

---

# ‚ú® Key Takeaways from Case Studies

* **System Design**: Decide modules, data flow, architecture.
* **Software Design**: Implement classes, database schema, algorithms.
* **Characteristics Applied**: Scalability (support more students/books), Reliability (no data loss), Availability (24/7 access), Maintainability (easy updates).

---

‚úÖ **Checkpoint for Students**

* How would you modify the **Library Management System** to support **e-books and digital lending**?
* In the **Student Record System**, how would you ensure scalability if the university expands to **10 lakh students**?

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint Answers

***

#### 1. How would you modify the **Library Management System (LMS)** to support **e-books and digital lending**?

**Modifications:**

1. **Extend the Book Entity**  
   - Add fields like `format` (physical/ebook), `fileURL`, `DRM details` to the `Book` entity.
2. **Add a Digital Lending Module**  
   - Implement an ‚ÄúeBook Lending Service‚Äù responsible for issuing access to digital content with limits on concurrent borrows, loan period, and digital rights management (DRM).
3. **Update Transaction Logic**  
   - Modify the standard issue/return processes to handle digital checkouts:
     - Immediate online access or download link on ‚ÄúIssue.‚Äù
     - Automatic return or access expiry after the lending period.
4. **User Interface Updates**  
   - Provide options to filter/search for ebooks vs. physical books.
   - Offer ‚ÄúRead Online‚Äù or ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù buttons for e-books.
5. **Access Control & DRM Integration**  
   - Integrate with DRM providers to prevent unauthorized sharing or downloads.
6. **Scalability**  
   - Ensure server infrastructure can handle multiple simultaneous digital users (e.g., streaming ebooks, managing online access).

***

#### 2. In the **Student Record System (SRS)**, how would you ensure **scalability** if the university expands to **10 lakh (1 million) students**?

**Scalability Approaches:**

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Use a high-performance, horizontally scalable database (e.g., sharding data by student ID or department).
   - Choose a distributed SQL/NoSQL system that supports partitioning and replication.
2. **Microservices/Modular Architecture**
   - Split the application into microservices (Student Service, Course Service, Grades Service) to allow independent scaling.
   - Deploy critical modules (like grade and enrollment handling) on separate infrastructure to reduce bottlenecks.
3. **Caching Frequently Accessed Data**
   - Use in-memory caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for student info, course catalogs, and transcripts to reduce DB load.
4. **Load Balancing**
   - Deploy load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple application instances/servers.
5. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Use background job queues for heavy operations (e.g., generating transcripts, batch grade uploads).
6. **Cloud Infrastructure**
   - Host on scalable cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) supporting auto-scaling and high availability.
   - Leverage CDN for serving static data (transcript PDFs, course catalogs).
7. **Monitoring and Auto-Scaling**
   - Implement real-time monitoring to detect traffic spikes and trigger auto-scaling of resources as needed.
