This part is about the **approaches engineers use when they start designing a system**.

# **4. Design Methodologies**

When faced with a complex system (say, designing **Instagram**), how do you start?
Do you start by thinking about the **whole system first** or by **designing small parts** and assembling them?

That‚Äôs where **Top-Down**, **Bottom-Up**, and **Modular Design** come into play.

---

## üîπ **1. Top-Down Design**

* **Definition**: Start with a **big picture** of the system and break it into smaller, more detailed parts.
* Focus: **Architecture first, details later.**
* Steps:

  1. Define overall system goal.
  2. Break into subsystems (e.g., Authentication, Feed, Messaging).
  3. Further refine each subsystem until implementation details are clear.

üëâ **Example:**
Designing a **Food Delivery App (like Swiggy/Zomato)**:

* Start ‚Üí ‚ÄúCustomer places an order.‚Äù
* Break down into ‚Üí Menu browsing, Cart, Payment, Delivery tracking.
* Then ‚Üí Go inside each (e.g., Payment ‚Üí Card validation, Wallet, UPI).

**Pros:**

* Clear structure.
* Easy to understand system hierarchy.
* Ensures **requirements are not missed**.

**Cons:**

* May delay coding because you‚Äôre stuck in ‚Äúplanning‚Äù mode.
* Risk of **over-designing**.

---

## üîπ **2. Bottom-Up Design**

* **Definition**: Start by building **small components/modules** and then integrate them into larger systems.
* Focus: **Implementation first, architecture emerges later.**
* Steps:

  1. Build reliable small modules.
  2. Integrate modules into bigger subsystems.
  3. System emerges as modules connect.

üëâ **Example:**
Same **Food Delivery App**:

* First build a **Payment Service** as an independent module.
* Then build an **Order Service**.
* Finally, integrate Payment + Order + Delivery.

**Pros:**

* Faster prototyping (good for startups).
* Useful when **modules are already available** (like APIs, SDKs).

**Cons:**

* System may become **disorganized** if integration is not planned well.
* Risk of missing big-picture requirements.

---

## üîπ **3. Modular Design**

* **Definition**: Designing a system as a collection of **independent, interchangeable modules** that interact via well-defined interfaces.
* Idea: *‚ÄúDivide and conquer‚Äù* but keep each module **loosely coupled** and **highly cohesive**.
* Each module can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

üëâ **Example:**
For the **Food Delivery App**:

* Modules:

  * **User Service** (login, profile, preferences).
  * **Restaurant Service** (menu, ratings).
  * **Order Service** (cart, order processing).
  * **Payment Service**.
  * **Delivery Service**.
* These interact through **APIs** but are independent.

**Pros:**

* Easier maintenance & upgrades.
* Supports team-based development (each team owns a module).
* Encourages reusability.

**Cons:**

* Requires **clear interface definitions**.
* More complex communication between modules.

### üîπ **Visual Analogy**

* **Top-Down** ‚Üí Architect designs city ‚Üí Planners design neighborhoods ‚Üí Builders construct houses.
* **Bottom-Up** ‚Üí Builders construct houses ‚Üí Later connect them with roads ‚Üí Eventually forms a city.
* **Modular** ‚Üí Pre-designed neighborhoods (modules) connected by roads (interfaces).

### ‚úÖ **Checkpoint for Students**

* Which design methodology would you choose for:

  1. A **university management system** developed by a single team?
  2. A **ride-hailing app (like Uber)** with multiple teams working in parallel?

---

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint Answers

#### 1. University Management System (Developed by a Single Team)

**Recommended Design Methodology:**  
- **Top-Down Design** (often combined with Modular Design)

**Why?**  
- With just one team, starting with the **big-picture architecture** helps clarify all requirements and dependencies from the outset.
- The team can define the full system (e.g., student records, course management, billing) and then break it into smaller modules.
- Modular design naturally follows, letting the team build independent pieces (like "Admissions Module," "Exam Controller Module")‚Äîbut all under a single, unified architectural vision.

**Key Point:**  
- **Top-Down + Modular** = Clear structure and easier coordination for a small team.

#### 2. Ride-Hailing App (Like Uber, Multiple Teams in Parallel)

**Recommended Design Methodology:**  
- **Modular Design** (with a Bottom-Up, team-driven approach)

**Why?**  
- Large systems with many teams require clear interface definitions so teams can work in parallel without blocking each other.
- Each feature (e.g., Payments, Driver Matching, Notifications) can be built as an independent module, often following microservices principles.
- Modular design enables **parallel development**, maintenance, and scaling of individual pieces.

**Reality:**  
- In practice, this often combines Bottom-Up (each team builds modules independently) and Modular Design (integration via clear APIs).

**Key Point:**  
- **Modular Approach** = Teams independently own, develop, and deploy modules, ensuring fast progress and scalability.
