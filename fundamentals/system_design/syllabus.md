# **SYSTEM DESIGN – Detailed Syllabus (Proposed for 5th Semester CSE)**

### **Course Objectives**

* To introduce the principles of system design and its role in software engineering.
* To develop the ability to analyze requirements, design scalable systems, and evaluate trade-offs.
* To expose students to real-world system design problems across distributed systems, databases, and networking.
* To prepare students for advanced courses, research, and industry-level system design interviews.

## **UNIT I – Introduction to System Design**

* Definition of systems and system design.
* Difference between software design and system design.
* Characteristics of good system design (scalability, reliability, availability, maintainability).
* Design methodologies: top-down, bottom-up, modular design.
* Case studies: designing a library management system, student record system.

---

## **UNIT II – Requirements and Modeling**

* Requirements analysis: functional vs. non-functional.
* Use cases, user stories, and system requirements specification.
* Unified Modeling Language (UML):

  * Use case diagrams
  * Class diagrams
  * Sequence diagrams
  * Component and deployment diagrams
* System architecture styles: monolithic, layered, microservices.

---

## **UNIT III – Core Design Concepts**

* Data flow diagrams (DFD) and Entity-Relationship diagrams (ERD).
* Database design and normalization in system design.
* Caching strategies and trade-offs.
* Load balancing concepts.
* Designing APIs: REST vs. gRPC.
* Security considerations in system design.

---

## **UNIT IV – Distributed System Design**

* Basics of distributed systems.
* Client-server, peer-to-peer, and service-oriented architecture.
* CAP theorem and PACELC trade-offs.
* Consistency models: strong, eventual, causal.
* Message queues, publish/subscribe models.
* Fault tolerance and redundancy.
* Case study: designing a scalable chat application.

---

## **UNIT V – Scalable System Design (Case Studies)**

* High-level design of:

  * URL shortener (TinyURL)
  * File storage service (Google Drive/Dropbox)
  * Social media feed system (Twitter/Facebook)
  * E-commerce system design (Amazon-like checkout flow)
* Performance considerations: sharding, partitioning, replication.
* Monitoring and observability in systems.
* Ethics and sustainability in system design.

---

## **Laboratory Component (if applicable)**

* Modeling small systems with UML diagrams.
* Prototyping API endpoints for given requirements.
* Mini-project: design and document a real-world system (e.g., food delivery, online exam portal).
* Simulation of load balancing using open-source tools.

---

## **Course Outcomes**

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Analyze system requirements and prepare specifications.
2. Apply modeling tools and techniques to represent system components.
3. Design scalable and reliable system architectures.
4. Evaluate trade-offs in design choices.
5. Implement and test small-scale system design solutions.
