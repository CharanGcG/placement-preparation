That‚Äôs a really smart way to think about it üëå ‚Äî system design interviews are broad, and the trick is to **prepare by covering the core building blocks and patterns** rather than memorizing designs.

Here‚Äôs a **structured roadmap of sub-topics** you should be thorough with:

---

# üìò **System Design Interview Prep Topics**

---

## 1. **Fundamentals**

* **Scalability basics** ‚Äì vertical vs. horizontal scaling
* **Latency vs. throughput**
* **Availability vs. consistency**
* **CAP theorem** (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)
* **ACID vs. BASE** properties

---

## 2. **Networking & Communication**

* **HTTP/HTTPS, REST, gRPC, WebSockets**
* **TCP vs. UDP trade-offs**
* **Load balancing** (round robin, least connections, consistent hashing)
* **Reverse proxies, CDNs**

---

## 3. **Storage & Databases**

* **SQL vs. NoSQL** (when to use each)
* **Sharding, replication, partitioning**
* **Indexes, caching queries**
* **Distributed databases** (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB)
* **Message queues with persistence (Kafka, RabbitMQ)**

---

## 4. **Caching**

* **When to cache (read-heavy workloads, hot data)**
* **Cache eviction policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO)**
* **Write-through, write-around, write-back strategies**
* **Tools: Redis, Memcached**

---

## 5. **Consistency & Reliability**

* **Eventual consistency**
* **Leader/follower replication**
* **Consensus algorithms** (Raft, Paxos ‚Äì at least know the concept)
* **Quorum reads/writes**

---

## 6. **System Components & Patterns**

* **Monolith vs. Microservices vs. Serverless**
* **API gateways**
* **Message queues & Pub/Sub**
* **Job schedulers & cron services**
* **Rate limiting & throttling**
* **Service discovery (e.g., Consul, Eureka, Kubernetes DNS)**

---

## 7. **Scalability Patterns**

* **Database scaling** ‚Äì read replicas, sharding
* **Application scaling** ‚Äì stateless servers, containerization (Docker, K8s)
* **Content Delivery Networks (CDN)**
* **Partitioning users/data to reduce load**

---

## 8. **Security**

* **Authentication vs. Authorization**
* **OAuth2, JWT tokens, API keys**
* **Transport encryption (TLS)**
* **Data encryption at rest**
* **Rate limiting to prevent abuse**

---

## 9. **Monitoring & Operations**

* **Logging, Metrics, Tracing**
* **Health checks**
* **Circuit breakers (to prevent cascading failures)**
* **Autoscaling strategies**

---

## 10. **High-Level Architectures (Case Studies)**

Practice **designing common systems**, because interviewers love to test practical applications:

* URL shortener (TinyURL)
* Social media feed (Twitter/Instagram)
* Messaging system (WhatsApp/Slack)
* Ride-hailing app (Uber/Ola)
* Video streaming (YouTube/Netflix)
* E-commerce (Amazon/Flipkart)
* Payment systems

---

‚úÖ If you prepare these **10 sub-areas**, you‚Äôll be equipped to handle almost any system design question ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdesign WhatsApp‚Äù type or a deeper one like ‚Äúhow do you ensure strong consistency in a distributed system?‚Äù
