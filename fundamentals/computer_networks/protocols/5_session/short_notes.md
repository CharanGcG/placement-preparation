# üìò Detailed Notes on Protocols in **Session Layer** of the OSI Model

---

## 1. **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**

### Definition

A protocol that allows a program to execute a procedure (function) on another computer as if it were local.

### Explanation

RPC abstracts network communication. Instead of writing socket code, developers call a function, and the underlying RPC framework takes care of transmitting the request and response. It manages **session establishment, synchronization, and termination**.

### Examples

* NFS (Network File System) uses RPC.
* Microsoft‚Äôs DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model).
* Microservices calling functions over gRPC (modern RPC).

### Analogy

RPC is like **ordering food over the phone** ‚Äî you ask as if the restaurant were in your home, but behind the scenes, your request is sent across a network and processed remotely.

## 2. **NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)**

### Definition

An API and protocol that allows applications on different computers in a LAN to communicate.

### Explanation

NetBIOS provides services related to session establishment and termination in LANs. It operates over transport protocols (like TCP/IP) but itself is part of the session layer. Modern Windows networking still has traces of NetBIOS.

### Examples

* File sharing in older Windows networks.
* Printer sharing over LAN.

### Analogy

NetBIOS is like a **nickname directory at a party** ‚Äî instead of remembering full details, you just ask for ‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù and the system connects you.

## 3. **PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)**

### Definition

A tunneling protocol that enables VPNs by encapsulating network packets into PPP frames.

### Explanation

PPTP creates a secure session (tunnel) between a client and a server, commonly used in early VPNs. It handles **session establishment, encryption, and termination**. However, it is now considered **obsolete** due to weak encryption.

### Examples

* Early corporate VPNs.
* Remote user connections to office intranets.

### Analogy

PPTP is like **an old lock on a safe** ‚Äî it secures the session, but modern thieves (hackers) can break it easily.

---

## 4. **SMB (Server Message Block)**

### Definition

A protocol that allows file, printer, and resource sharing across a network.

### Explanation

SMB operates at the session layer by establishing and maintaining persistent sessions between clients and servers. It allows **stateful connections** (keeping track of open files, locks, etc.) for reliable sharing.

### Examples

* Windows file and printer sharing.
* Network-attached storage (NAS).

### Analogy

SMB is like a **shared office workspace** ‚Äî multiple employees can access shared files, printers, and resources in a controlled way.

---

## 5. **SQL Session Protocols** *(indirect, session-layer concepts)*

### Definition

Database connection protocols that manage sessions between clients and database servers.

### Explanation

When an application connects to a database, the session protocol maintains login, transaction state, and termination. Protocols like TDS (Tabular Data Stream for Microsoft SQL Server) or Oracle‚Äôs Net8 handle session-layer duties.

### Examples

* Connecting to Oracle, SQL Server, or PostgreSQL.

### Analogy

Like **logging into a library system** ‚Äî you authenticate, borrow books (queries), and log out when finished.
