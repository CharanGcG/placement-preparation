# üåê Computer Network Protocols Cheat Sheet (OSI Model)

| **Layer** | **Description** | **Example Protocols** | **Analogy (Memory Hook)** |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **7. Application** | Interfaces with user apps; provides services like email, web, file transfer. | HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, DHCP, SNMP | **Restaurant Menu** ‚Äì You (user) choose a meal (service) from the menu (protocols). |
| **6. Presentation** | Translates, encrypts, and compresses data for the app layer. | TLS/SSL, JPEG, GIF, MPEG | **Translator at UN** ‚Äì Converts one language (data format) into another understandable form. |
| **5. Session** | Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions. | NetBIOS, PPTP, SAP | **Meeting Host** ‚Äì Starts meetings, keeps order, and ends them when done. |
| **4. Transport** | Ensures reliable end-to-end delivery of data, with error checking and flow control. | TCP, UDP, SCTP | **Courier Service** ‚Äì Decides whether to use tracked shipping (TCP) or regular mail (UDP). |
| **3. Network** | Decides the best path for data packets, handles logical addressing (IP). | IP (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP, OSPF, BGP, RIP | **GPS/Google Maps** ‚Äì Chooses the best route to reach the destination. |
| **2. Data Link** | Ensures reliable link-to-link delivery via MAC addressing and framing. | Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Wi-Fi (802.11), ARP, PPP | **Postal Clerk** ‚Äì Writes recipient‚Äôs house/apartment number on the mail to deliver correctly in a building. |
| **1. Physical** | Deals with actual transmission of raw bits over medium (cables, radio, light). | Ethernet cables, Fiber optics, Hubs, Bluetooth, RS-232 | **Road/Highway** ‚Äì The physical path cars (data) travel on. |
