**Title:**
Detailed Notes on Protocols in {layer} of the OSI Model

**Prompt:**
I want you to generate **comprehensive notes** on all the **major protocols that belong to the {layer} layer of the OSI model**.

For each protocol, provide the following sections:

1. **Protocol Name**
2. **Definition** – a short, precise definition.
3. **Explanation** – a clear, detailed explanation of how it works and why it’s used.
4. **Examples** – real-world examples or use cases of the protocol.
5. **Analogy** – a simple, memorable real-world analogy that makes the concept easy to recall in interviews.

After covering all protocols in that layer, provide:

* **A final markdown table** that summarizes all the protocols in that layer with columns:

  * Protocol
  * Definition (short form)
  * Example Use Case
  * Analogy

**Additional Instructions (Optional but Recommended):**

* Keep the tone **professional but easy to understand** (interview-prep friendly).
* If a protocol is outdated or less used today, mention it but keep the explanation short.
* Use **markdown formatting** with clear headings for each protocol and the summary table.
* Ensure the notes are **structured for quick revision** as well as deep understanding.

**Variables:**

* `{layer}` → 
* `{depth}` → Short revision / Medium detail / In-depth study.
