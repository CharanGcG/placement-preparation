# Top 10 Docker Interview Questions & Answers

---

1. **What is Docker and why is it used?**  
   **Detailed Answer:**  
   Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows you to package applications with all their dependencies, enabling consistent deployment across environments. Docker solves the “it works on my machine” problem and helps automate, isolate, and scale applications efficiently.  
   **Why the Interviewer Asks This:**  
   To assess if the candidate understands containerization basics and its practical advantages.  
   **Common Misconceptions:**  
   - Thinking Docker is only for developers; it’s widely used in DevOps, testing, and production too.

2. **What is the difference between an image and a container in Docker?**  
   **Detailed Answer:**  
   An image is a static, read-only template that defines what’s inside the container (app, libraries, config). A container is a running instance of an image—a live process with an isolated file system.  
   **Why the Interviewer Asks This:**  
   To check grasp of Docker’s core concepts of packaging vs. execution.  
   **Common Misconceptions:**  
   - Mixing up images and containers, believing they’re the same object.

---

3. **Explain the roles of Docker Client, Docker Host, and Docker Registry.**  
   **Detailed Answer:**  
   - **Client:** Interface (CLI/API) for users to interact with Docker (run, build, etc.).
   - **Host/Daemon:** The core component that manages containers and images, communicates with the registry.
   - **Registry:** Stores docker images (public as Docker Hub or private).  
   **Why the Interviewer Asks This:**  
   To ensure understanding of Docker’s architecture and workflow.  
   **Common Misconceptions:**  
   - Thinking only Docker Hub is a registry; private registries are common in organizations.

4. **What is a Dockerfile? Why is it important?**  
   **Detailed Answer:**  
   A Dockerfile is a text file with instructions for building a Docker image. It describes steps like copying files, installing dependencies, and setting up the runtime environment.  
   **Why the Interviewer Asks This:**  
   To check knowledge of automation and best practices for repeatable builds.  
   **Example:**  
   ```
   FROM node:14
   COPY . /app
   RUN npm install
   CMD ["node", "index.js"]
   ```
   **Common Misconceptions:**  
   - Thinking Dockerfiles are only for application code; they can configure OS, networks, etc.

---

5. **Describe the difference between COPY and ADD commands in a Dockerfile.**  
   **Detailed Answer:**  
   COPY straightforwardly copies files/directories. ADD does the same but also supports remote URLs and automatic extraction of compressed files (like .tar).  
   **Why the Interviewer Asks This:**  
   To assess attention to detail and best practice in image building.  
   **Common Misconceptions:**  
   - Always using ADD when COPY is safer and clearer for general copying.

---

6. **How do you persist data in Docker containers?**  
   **Detailed Answer:**  
   Data in containers is lost once the container is deleted. To persist, use volumes or bind mounts, which keep data outside the container lifecycle.  
   **Why the Interviewer Asks This:**  
   To confirm knowledge of state management and reliable storage.  
   **Common Misconceptions:**  
   - Assuming container data is permanent without volumes.

---

7. **What is the difference between a container and a virtual machine (VM)?**  
   **Detailed Answer:**  
   Containers share the host OS kernel, are lightweight, and start quickly. VMs emulate hardware, require separate OS instances, and use more resources.  
   **Why the Interviewer Asks This:**  
   To evaluate ability to compare technologies and understand isolation and overhead.  
   **Common Misconceptions:**  
   - Believing containers are less isolated or secure than VMs by default.

---

8. **What is Docker Compose and when would you use it?**  
   **Detailed Answer:**  
   Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container applications with a single YAML file, letting you control networks, volumes, and services together.  
   **Why the Interviewer Asks This:**  
   To check for ability to manage complex applications involving multiple containers.  
   **Example Compose snippet:**  
   ```yaml
   services:
     web:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
     db:
       image: postgres
   ```
   **Common Misconceptions:**  
   - Thinking Compose is only for orchestration; it’s also for development and testing setups.

---

9. **How do you list all running Docker containers?**  
   **Detailed Answer:**  
   Use the command:  
   ```
   docker ps
   ```
   This shows all running containers with their IDs, names, and status.  
   **Why the Interviewer Asks This:**  
   To confirm command-line fluency and operational basics.  
   **Common Misconceptions:**  
   - Using incorrect commands like `docker ls` instead of `docker ps`.

---

10. **What is Docker Swarm?**  
    **Detailed Answer:**  
    Docker Swarm is Docker’s native clustering and orchestration solution. It lets you manage a group of Docker hosts as a single virtual host, facilitating scaling, service discovery, high availability, and rolling updates.  
    **Why the Interviewer Asks This:**  
    To check if candidate knows orchestration and scaling capabilities, a key Docker feature.  
    **Common Misconceptions:**  
    - Thinking Swarm is the only orchestration option (Kubernetes is also popular).

---

These ten questions cover the make-or-break foundation for Docker, from basics to essential sub-concepts like orchestration, persistence, and architecture. Failing these is a sign of insufficient Docker expertise.
