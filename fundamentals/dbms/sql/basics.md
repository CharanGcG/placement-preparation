# ðŸ“˜ SQL Beginner Notes â€“ One-Stop Revision Guide  

***

## 1. Introduction to SQL & Databases
- **Definition:**  
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with relational databases.  
- **Explanation:**  
It allows you to create tables, insert data, query (fetch) data, update records, and manage database structure.  
- **Analogy:** Think of a **database as a library**, tables as **bookshelves**, rows as **entries in a book**, and SQL as the **librarian language** to fetch/organize/update books.  

Example:  
```sql
-- Select all data from a table called Students
SELECT * FROM Students;
```
This fetches every row and column from the `Students` table.

***

## 2. SQL Data Types
- **Definition:** Types of values that can be stored in a table column.  
- **Common Types:**  
  - `INT` â†’ integers (1, 100)  
  - `DECIMAL(p,s)` â†’ fixed-point numbers (12.34)  
  - `VARCHAR(n)` â†’ strings of variable length ("Alice")  
  - `CHAR(n)` â†’ fixed-length strings ("A")  
  - `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME` â†’ date/time values  
  - `BOOLEAN` â†’ TRUE/FALSE  

***

## 3. DDL Commands: CREATE, DROP, ALTER  
DDL (**Data Definition Language**) â†’ defines database structure  

### CREATE
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
  StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Age INT
);
```
ðŸ‘‰ Creates a table named `Students`.

### ALTER
```sql
ALTER TABLE Students ADD Email VARCHAR(100);
```
ðŸ‘‰ Adds a new column `Email`.

### DROP
```sql
DROP TABLE Students;
```
ðŸ‘‰ Deletes the table permanently.

***

## 4. DML Commands: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE  
DML (**Data Manipulation Language**) â†’ modifies data  

### INSERT
```sql
INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 20);
```

### UPDATE
```sql
UPDATE Students SET Age = 21 WHERE StudentID = 1;
```

### DELETE
```sql
DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 1;
```

***

## 5. SELECT Basics (Projection, Filtering, Sorting)
**Projection = selecting columns**, **Filtering = WHERE condition**, **Sorting = ORDER BY**.  

```sql
SELECT Name, Age FROM Students WHERE Age > 18 ORDER BY Age DESC;
```
ðŸ‘‰ Fetch `Name` & `Age` for students above 18, sorted by Age (highest first).

***

## 6. WHERE, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT
- **WHERE** â†’ filters rows  
- **DISTINCT** â†’ removes duplicates  
- **ORDER BY** â†’ sorts results  
- **LIMIT n** â†’ restricts row count  

Example:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Age FROM Students
WHERE Age >= 18
ORDER BY Age ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

***

## 7. Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
Used for summaries.  

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalStudents, AVG(Age) AS AvgAge
FROM Students;
```
ðŸ‘‰ Returns number of students and their average age.

***

## 8. GROUP BY and HAVING
- **GROUP BY** â†’ groups rows based on column(s).  
- **HAVING** â†’ like WHERE but applied after grouping.  

```sql
SELECT Age, COUNT(*) AS CountPerAge
FROM Students
GROUP BY Age
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
ðŸ‘‰ Finds age groups where more than 1 student exists.

***

## 9. Joins (Combining Multiple Tables)

- **INNER JOIN** â†’ common records only  
- **LEFT JOIN** â†’ all left + matching right  
- **RIGHT JOIN** â†’ all right + matching left  
- **FULL JOIN** â†’ all records from both  

Example:
```sql
SELECT S.Name, C.CourseName
FROM Students S
INNER JOIN Courses C
ON S.StudentID = C.StudentID;
```
ðŸ‘‰ Shows students with enrolled courses.  

*(Think of JOINs like overlapping circles in a Venn diagram.)*

***

## 10. Subqueries and Nested Queries
A query inside another query.  

```sql
SELECT Name FROM Students
WHERE Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM Students);
```
ðŸ‘‰ Finds students older than average age.  

***

## 11. Constraints
Rules applied to table columns.  
- **PRIMARY KEY** â†’ uniquely identifies row  
- **FOREIGN KEY** â†’ links to another tableâ€™s primary key  
- **UNIQUE** â†’ prevents duplicates  
- **NOT NULL** â†’ must have a value  
- **CHECK** â†’ enforces condition  
- **DEFAULT** â†’ auto value if not provided  

Example:  
```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
  OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  StudentID INT,
  Amount DECIMAL(8,2) CHECK (Amount > 0),
  FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID)
);
```

***

## 12. Indexes and Views
- **Index:** Speeds up searching.  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Students(Name);
```
- **View:** Virtual table of a saved query.  
```sql
CREATE VIEW AdultStudents AS
SELECT Name, Age FROM Students WHERE Age >= 18;
```

***

## 13. Transactions (ACID)  
- **Transaction = group of SQL statements that execute together.**  
- Supports **COMMIT** (save), **ROLLBACK** (undo), **SAVEPOINT** (checkpoint).  

Example:  
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE Students SET Age = 22 WHERE StudentID = 1;
ROLLBACK;  -- undo
COMMIT;    -- final save
```

***

## 14. Normalization Basics
- **1NF (First Normal Form):** No repeating groups â†’ atomic values.  
- **2NF:** In 1NF + no partial dependency on composite key.  
- **3NF:** In 2NF + no transitive dependency (non-key depends only on key).  

ðŸ‘‰ Goal: **reduce redundancy, improve consistency**.  

***

## 15. SQL vs NoSQL (Quick Note)
- **SQL (Relational):** Structured data, fixed schema, ACID properties (MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
- **NoSQL (Non-relational):** Flexible schema, document/graph/column stores, good for scale & unstructured data (MongoDB, Cassandra).
