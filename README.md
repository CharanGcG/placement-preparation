## 🎯 Purpose
When preparing for placements, I often wished **everything was in one place** —  
this repo aims to be that central hub so I can:
- Revise faster before a test or interview.
- Reuse proven templates and notes.
- Keep track of learnings from past experiences.

---

## 🚀 Usage
1. **Before a coding test:**  
   - Go to `dsa/templates` for quick-start code.
   - Review relevant `fundamentals` topics.
2. **Before an interview:**  
   - Revise `interviews` folder for behavioral and technical questions.
3. **For long-term prep:**  
   - Keep updating `handmade-notes` and `experience-journal` after each attempt.

---

## 📌 Future Plans
- Add topic-wise question lists with difficulty tags.
- Include last-minute revision PDFs.
- Document company-specific preparation strategies.
