- Revise faster before a test or interview.  
- Reuse proven templates and notes.  
- Keep track of learnings from past experiences.

## üöÄ Usage  
1. **Before a coding test:**  
   - Go to `dsa/templates` for quick-start code.  
   - Review relevant `fundamentals` topics.  
2. **Before an interview:**  
   - Revise `interviews` folder for behavioral and technical questions.  
3. **Before aptitude or other tests:**  
   - Check out the `aptitude` folder for tricks and practice.  
4. **For long-term prep:**  
   - Keep updating `brainstorming` and `experience-journal` after each attempt.
